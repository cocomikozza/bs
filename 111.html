The heads of the Judiciary, the Legislature, and the Executive branch.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The Director of the Research Institute — responsible for magic research and development.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The Commander in Chief — also known as the Grand Marshal.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Gathered here were the twelve members that made up the supreme executive body of the Theocracy. This was where those with the highest authority in the Theocracy congregated, where they set out the general roadmap for the country.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It was neither spacious nor opulent, and none of those in attendance were without a somber expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Not many people would be joyous given the occasion of course. The assembly was composed of people who would consider each other comrades, and they were familiar enough with one another to allow for some occasional humor. That is to say, the mood among them was once a lot more light-hearted, but not at this time. The air in the room felt as though it had frozen solid.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“The Sorcerer Kingdom has begun their invasion of the Kingdom, or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that it had started long before now. The Sorcerer Kingdom is truly terrifying, the Kingdom never had an inkling of their plans for an entire month. They have suppressed the Windflower and Clearwater scriptures, which had served as our eyes and ears. Had it not been for the Thousand Leagues Astrologer, we might have discovered it even later… It is fair to conclude that the Kingdom’s fate is sealed. We don’t have much time on our hands, so we should start recruiting adventurers as soon as possible.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“We’ve already begun recruiting in earnest,” replied the Cardinal of Earth, Raymond Zarg Lauransan.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Isn’t it a waste to just allow the Sorcerer Kingdom to plunder that country’s</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">magic items? Can’t we get our hands on them somehow? Especially the treasures of the Kingdom. The Amulet of Immortality, Guardian Armor, Gauntlets of Vitality, and…” The Research Director said as he counted up with his fingers as if to emphasize the importance of the last item, “…Razor Edge.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“No, there’s nothing we can do about that. The number of people we can deploy is limited. Even our own people within the Kingdom will not be able to make it out alive.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…The Sorcerer Kingdom will be at our doorsteps soon. Ever since that Warrior-Captain died in battle, his replacement, the one called… Ung-lo? Is the one with the items now, right?” The Grand Marshal asked, to which the Research Director answered, “Brain, correct? Yes, if we could extract him along with those items it would be for the best. He shouldn’t be the type to run towards his own death, right? We might anger him at first but he’ll soon be grateful to us.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“According to our investigation, he’s not someone who would do that.” The Cardinal of Fire, Berenice Nagua Santini, was one of the only two women within the executive body. “Your opinion of him is quite high,” the other woman, the head of the Judiciary, said with a smile.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Indeed. We Cardinals do evaluate him highly, but we know he’s not the type of person to accept our invitation. That’s why we gave the order not to contact him.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“So he’s the same as that Warrior-Captain… Well, we fundamentally cannot understand the thoughts of people who don’t look at the bigger picture and allow themselves to be controlled by such irrational emotions.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A few people glared at the head of the Legislature as he spoke, so he felt the need to backtrack. “My apologies, perhaps that was a bit too harsh. Still, in my opinion — taking into consideration the future of mankind, such reckless disregard for life is a terrible mentality to have. I will stand by my point no matter who stands against it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I won’t deny that.” The one who uttered those words was Dominic Ihre Partouche, the Cardinal of Wind and one of the people who glared earlier. “However, just as we have lines we would never cross, so does he.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">“Does Guelfi-sensei agree?” The Research Director asked, not fully convinced. Ginedine Delan Guelfi, the Cardinal of Water — an elderly man whose appearance was akin to that of a dried log — nodded in confirmation. “I shall not</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">ask further on this matter then.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“While I’m glad so many talents have come to join our nation, what is their</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">condition?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Many adventurer teams were already on their way to the Theocracy. Most were Mythril rank or higher, but they were also using the Clearwater Scripture’s intelligence to invite people with potential.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Not very goo— no, it’s just bad” The one in charge of receiving the adventurers, Yvon Jasna Dracowa, the Cardinal of light, chimed in.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“We may have convinced them to come, but the fact that they had to abandon so many people has left a thorn in their hearts— Or in other words, they’re wimps.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One of the participants spoke in a way that let everyone know that the conversation didn’t need to be so formal. But in response, Yvon gave a stern reply: “You should always be formal in front of your bosses.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He became flustered. “I mean, superiors,” he corrected himself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was true that in a meeting strictly between cardinals even Yvon was informal from time to time. But that was only possible because all six of them were close.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“So… we think we should get rid of this ‘thorn’ as soon as possible.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“But how?” the head of the Judiciary asked. Raymond replied, “Well, if the ‘thorn’ set in because they couldn’t save people, then it can be healed by saving people. We’ll send them to the Draconic Kingdom first. We’ll have them fight the beastmen there.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Ah, I see,” those around him said out loud.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Their intelligence indicated that the Draconic Kingdom had become diplomatically closer to the Sorcerer Kingdom and had even purchased undead from them. Terribly powerful undead at that.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If they allowed this to continue, the Theocracy’s influence within the Draconic Kingdom would diminish while the Sorcerer Kingdom would only gain more sway. As a preventive measure, this proposal could be a good move. However, someone was still worried:</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“If we send the adventurers we recruited somewhere beyond our surveillance they could leak our secret operations during the war. Would that not expose our covert actions to the Sorcerer Kingdom? Would it not be safer to keep them within our borders for now?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“That’s likely not a problem. They know the situation in the Kingdom. They regret leaving all those people behind. It’s unlikely that people like that would ever work with such a cruel nation. Though there is the possibility of them obtaining the information through mind-controlling magic.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Hold on, compared to that, wouldn’t it be more of a problem should the Sorcerer Kingdom discover that our country has magic casters capable of using teleportation magic?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Indeed, that’s true.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“We’ve always pretended to use magic items to teleport people but some adventurers might have seen through our ruse. Even if we were to impose a gag order on them, there’s no way to know where and how information could leak. Maybe we should avoid revealing we have that card in our hand.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ginedine Delan Guelfi, the Cardinal of Water, coughed a few times before he spoke. “Hm, excuse me. While I understand your thought process, is it not true that revealing our hand to our opponent can make them more cautious about acting recklessly? This move could also work to restrain our opponents. At least that’s what I think.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I agree with Sensei’s idea. …the Tri-Arts Magic Caster is a great example of someone who’s capable of teleportation. We don’t need to be so nervous.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Hmm. But how many would know about that? ‘What kind of magic is the great magic caster of the Empire capable of’ is a question that even we don’t have a definite answer for, is it not?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Someone like that wouldn’t care much for intelligence on teleportation magic anyway.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">All sorts of ideas were suggested. The Pontifex Maximus felt that they would not be able to reach a decision if this continued on, so he decided on a simple vote. And so, it was decided that they would deploy the adventurers to provide support to the Draconic Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That said, the recruited adventurers were no different from mercenaries in the eyes of the Theocracy. They weren’t expecting any loyalty out of them. Thus, the leaders of the Theocracy gathered here didn’t mind even if they chose to stay in the Draconic Kingdom. After all, rescuing them from the Kingdom wasn’t to strengthen the Theocracy, but to avoid the possibility of strong humans dying in vain.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">“If we manage to develop the technique to create spell scrolls of the fifth tier and above, even something like teleportation magic will become easily available.” “But even though we have worked on it for centuries, nothing came of it, not</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">even the smallest bit of progress.”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One of the Theocracy’s secret technologies was the manufacturing method for scrolls up to the fourth tier. This was something the surrounding countries did</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">not have. The Theocracy possesses many other secret technologies such as this. After all, they’ve been developing them for hundreds of years—all to protect humanity from the races surpassing them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">For example, they also succeeded in creating the potion known as “God’s blood.” However, its cost-effectiveness was terrible, so research continued to this day.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Still, why would the Sorcerer King order such massacres? Even if supplies en route to the Holy Kingdom were robbed, this was still an overreaction. What does the military make of it?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“The first reason is for it to act as a show of strength.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The Grand Marshal raised one finger. Multiple heads nodded in agreement. “Second, the Sorcerer King is an undead after all.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“‘There’s a deep-seated hatred for the living in him, and he is controlled by that hatred.’ Perhaps some may hold that belief, but I disagree. Even if we assume he has been waiting for an opportune time to go to war, if we take into account his previous actions, this incident still feels strange.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“That’s right. Even us from the military believe that line of thought leads to nowhere,” said the Grand Marshal with a stern face. But then other voices arose in protest saying things like: “then just say that without posturing,” or “you just wanted to copy Raymond,” or “you need to consider time and place before you speak.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Ehem… And lastly the most probable one, reason number three:” he said as he raised his third finger, “to create a natural spawning area for the undead, like the Katze Plains.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“That is possible,” someone murmured.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The Slaine Theocracy was a country that boasted an abundance of divine magic casters, so the highest echelon in attendance fully understood what the Grand Marshal meant.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The Sorcerer King’s plan was to probably expand that unholy land endlessly and then absorb any undead that spawned there into his kingdom. Such a thing was normally impossible, but the Sorcerer King, being an undead himself, was an exception.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They had heard that he had assumed control of the Katze Plains. Perhaps he had obtained something from there that would prompt him to do something like this.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“If that’s the case, we can anticipate their next move.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Why are you so certain of that?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“He created those unholy lands to serve as a buffer between him and the Council State. That way, the unholy lands will help protect his country from the Council state, then—”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—He’ll be able to turn his attention towards the Theocracy, huh.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The room fell into silence. All members present compared the Sorcerer Kingdom to their own country, especially in terms of military power.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Everyone bore pained expressions. No one could maintain composure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The reaction was understandable, as they were reminded of the intel they had received regarding the Sorcerer Kingdom during their last meeting. The Sorcerer Kingdom’s battle against the Kingdom on the Katze Plains displayed their undeniably overwhelming and malevolent power.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The Sorcerer Kingdom was extremely tricky to deal with, even for the trump card of the Theocracy, the Black Scripture and its God-kin members. Moreover, the true power of the Sorcerer Kingdom remained unknown. The more they investigated, the more it felt like staring into a dark, bottomless abyss.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“No number of troops would be enough. So we have to form a comprehensive alliance with the Council State, huh…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“That’s right. Then whenever we’re in a pinch, we will be able to receive reinforcements!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Everyone smiled sarcastically.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Reinforcements powerful enough to save the Theocracy would never be sent.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That much was plain to see.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">True cooperation is impossible for states with completely different goals and ideals. Some reinforcement could be expected if an alliance was formed, but there was no way that the Platinum Dragon Lord himself would come to their aid.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If either the Theocracy or the Council State fell, then the full might of the Sorcerer Kingdom would come to bear on the nation not yet affected. To avoid that, the correct move would be full cooperation: to pool their strengths together against the Sorcerer Kingdom. However, hypothetically, if the alliance were to invade the Sorcerer Kingdom and win, what would happen afterward? Naturally, the two countries would return to seeing each other as potential enemies.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They just needed to think a bit about the future and they’d realize it was in their best interests to let the other country’s soldiers fall to the Sorcerer Kingdom. Plus, if they establish an alliance, people will flow between their</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">nations and that would make the intelligence warfare between them even more intense.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Complete and mutual trust was never going to happen, even if an alliance was formed.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It was more realistic to think of winning with only the Theocracy’s troops.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">And besides, even if war broke out with the Sorcerer Kingdom, both parties would avoid total war so they don’t destroy each other. If they didn’t, the only winner would be the Council State.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The ideal situation would be a three-way deadlock, but that would require a more equal power balance.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Submitting to the Sorcerer Kingdom would not be a bad thing. We could work behind the scenes for decades or centuries until we make them crumble from the inside. It would also grant us a clearer picture of the Sorcerer Kingdom’s internal affairs.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“The Empire became a vassal too, so it isn’t completely unfeasible. Also, judging by how the Empire was treated, it is not that bad of an option.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“But if we do that, will we be able to convince our citizens?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“It would be very difficult. Normal citizens won’t ever be convinced. And if we handle it poorly, riots could break out.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Just brand them as fools.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Oy, that’s a bit too extreme. Save that as the last resort. First things first, unlike us, citizens don’t have access to all this information.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Then, should we make everything we know about the Sorcerer Kingdom public? Aren’t we keeping it a secret right now precisely because it led to unrest in the past?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Stop arguing. Even if the Sorcerer Kingdom took the Kingdom’s capital, they wouldn’t have time to pacify the population and administer the new territory. We still have some time to think about such things—”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—No, we can’t say that for certain. After all, the Sorcerer Kingdom already destroyed multiple cities and villages. There’s no guarantee they won’t do the same to the capital.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The capital was very populous. Killing all those people seemed a bit unrealistic but the Sorcerer Kingdom might be capable of doing it.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“An undead, full of hatred of the living, huh.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“We let our guard down because there was no unnecessary killing at E-Rantel, didn’t we?”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“The Empire is now a vassal, they have intervened with matters within the Holy Kingdom and the Draconic Kingdom, and now they are trampling over the Kingdom. Next is our turn, I’m sure. ‘Submit or die.’ There’s nothing more clichéd than that but even so, I’m sure the Sorcerer Kingdom will eventually force us to make that decision. If we want to avoid that we’ll need to solve one of our problems while confronting the Sorcerer Kingdom.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Indeed. We should annihilate that rotten Elf as soon as possible. Although our future relationship with the Sorcerer Kingdom is not yet clear, battling on two fronts would be foolish.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A huge amount of effort was put into exterminating the Elven country, even before the Sorcerer Kingdom was established. That was also why they couldn’t dedicate their full attention to the Sorcerer Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Direct confrontation with the Sorcerer Kingdom is the worst-case scenario, considering their overwhelming military power. Still, it is our duty to make plans with the worst case in mind, and I’m sure they’d prefer to end everything in a short time.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“The Sorcerer Kingdom probably won’t intervene while their army is in the Kingdom, but it’s possible they’ll try to prevent us from responding to this sudden turn of events. For example, they could make undead appear at our borders as a distraction while pretending that they naturally appeared. We must take some steps to prepare for that possibility.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Yes… at the same time, we must work to give humanity a chance, even if it’s a small one.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A few of them nodded faithfully.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“We’ll evacuate some of the citizens. To the land of hope. No, to the ends of despair”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They may call it an ‘evacuation,’ but the Theocracy didn’t know of any other country that’d take their citizens in. Therefore, they weren’t planning to make them refugees.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The Theocracy had a single shelter outside its borders. You could call it a hidden village, but originally— 600 years ago, it was where humans lived when they only knew fear and flight.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was guarded by one of the Six Scriptures, the Ashendust Scripture.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“If we’re going to evacuate them we should start preparing right now. Who are we choosing?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“We can’t choose randomly. We’ll obviously stay behind. As for the rest of the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">citizens, how about we make them elect a representative and make that person choose?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“No, Lauransan-sama should go.” “What?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“In the unlikely event that we’re annihilated, only a former member of the Black Scripture like you would be able to protect and teach those who are left, right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I’m not as strong as before. And besides, the heads of the organization are the ones who should remain no matter what happens. If they were to disappear, people would lose faith in the organization. ”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“But—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“No—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“I was thinking—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As the discussion grew heated, the Pontifex Maximus finally spoke, “Getting heated about this is pointless. It is an important matter, but let’s postpone it for now.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No one objected.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Right. Then, let us talk about the most important issue. The Elves. It’s fine if the rest of the Elves run away, but we can’t let the Elven King go. We have to corner that fucker no matter wha— ”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The Pontifex Maximus was like a completely different person, with palpable hatred on his face. Raymond nodded in agreement.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“This will give Certain Death a chance to choose.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Indeed. Even if the Platinum Dragon Lord sensed her leaving the country, he is unlikely to pursue the matter strongly given the current situation. Personally, I think we should give the Elven King a taste of all the suffering in the world and then kill him, but that girl’s happiness takes priority. I’m counting on you all.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Understood.”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s12" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s13" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark9">r</a><span class="s14">&lt;</span>r,<a name="bookmark13">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s15" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">:::c</p><p class="s16" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">r­</p><p class="s17" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">e</p><p class="s15" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">:::c</p><p class="s18" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">C,</p><p class="s19" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 437pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">r ,</p><p class="s20" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">1<span style=" color: #2A281F;">5</span></p><p class="s22" style="padding-left: 437pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 4pt;text-align: left;">L <span class="s23">.J</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s24" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">CJ</p><p class="s25" style="padding-left: 439pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;">0</p><p class="s26" style="padding-left: 441pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;">CL</p><p class="s27" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">:<span class="s28">t</span>:<span class="s28">:</span>:<span class="s28">-</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s29" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 167pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">C<span style=" color: #0F0C0A;">h</span>a<span style=" color: #0F0C0A;">pt</span>e<span style=" color: #0F0C0A;">r I </span><span class="s31">To Take A Paid Vacation</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="646" height="925" alt="image" src="Overlord%20Volume%2015%20-%20The%20Half-Elf%20God-kin%20Part%20I_files/Image_007.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark10">Chapter 1 | To Take A Paid Vacation</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After reading through the contents of the thick binder to the end, Ainz returned to the first page and stamped his personal seal with a plop. After a brief moment of hesitation, he also stamped the seal of approval. With this, the matter printed in this binder — from Ainz’s point of view, some sort of ultra-high-level solution for a political issue — was approved and Albedo could begin the process of selecting the appropriate personnel to dispatch.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz handed the binder to Lumière, who was waiting by his side. This concluded the last of his work for the day. Ainz glanced over at the clock.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The clock’s hands read 10:30.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz’s work started at 10:00. In other words, his workday didn’t last even half an hour, but this was the status quo as of late. Although Ainz’s work generally gets completed before noon, this was still far too quick.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Starting work this late was something that the salaryman Suzuki Satoru had never experienced, swing shifts aside, but that was nothing more than Satoru’s personal experience. It wasn’t rare for those employed by the megacorporations to start work late and according to Ulbert, the fact that such a shift system</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">existed was a kind of privilege in itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Well, considering the work lives of this world’s inhabitants (for example, villagers like Enri and Nfirea), starting work at sunrise and going to bed at sunset is the routine.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was mostly the same for the city dwellers, although their mornings started and their nights ended a bit later compared to the villagers. The availability of magical illumination — or the lack thereof — is the most important factor governing this. Nobles who had easy access to magical illumination were able to start their work late in the morning since they were able to work as late into the night as was necessary.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">So, did all of Nazarick start work at 10:00? Not at all. Nazarick was a black company among black companies.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">(T/N: A black company is a Japanese term for companies with poor working conditions.)</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">First, the regular maids were divided into morning and night shifts, and their working hours were long. It was the same for Cocytus’ vassals guarding the Ninth Floor. Break times were vaguely defined at best and hardly anyone took short rests. There was no time set aside for things like snacks or smoke breaks.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Even so, about 90% of those with such schedules were not discontented with their workload.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As someone who wanted to create a pleasant work environment for his subordinates, Ainz had asked the maids about this situation. His impression upon listening to their answers was, “there must be something wrong with their heads.” No, perhaps it would be better to say that their loyalty was sky-high.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz shuddered a bit when they said with serious faces that it’s completely normal to work without rest when you have items to nullify fatigue.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, the only demand made by the remaining 10% that were dissatisfied with their schedules was that they wanted even more work.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">However — that’s in the past.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps it was him just being selfish, but Ainz had always wanted to provide his employees with generous benefits. To this end, Ainz started by focusing his attention on the regular maids.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was because first of all, they were extremely low-leveled. The fact that they were all attractive women was also significant. While Ainz didn’t want to play favorites, he always ends up being soft on the maids compared to Cocytus’ vassals.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">If he accomplished his wish through an order, nearly everyone in Nazarick would obey it without question, but doing so might damage their morale.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">So he needed to make a good argument, which he did with the following explanation:</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In the future, the regular maids might need to train and manage human maids. When that time comes, they would need to take care not to overwork the human maids with the work routine they had been following up till now.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">While they protested initially, Ainz ultimately succeeded in reducing their working hours and increasing their leisure time.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Previously, they got one day off every forty-one days, but it had now been doubled.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">They get two now.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz still felt like nothing had really changed, but there would likely be stronger resistance if he tried to push further. Or rather, that was how Ainz read the mood, so he had to stand down at that point.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Consequently, Ainz failed to incorporate the day-off system — paid leaves, summer vacations, public holidays, etc.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Although he framed it as being for the benefit of the maids, perhaps the real reason he pushed for some kind of paid leave system despite the NPC’s opposition was because of Suzuki Satoru’s yearning for a concept he never got to experience for himself.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">And so Ainz ended up stumbling upon another idea.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As the ruler of Nazarick, Ainz reduced his own workload. He wanted everyone to think that it was alright to take it easy because Ainz himself wasn’t doing too much work. Of course, another part of the reason was the possibility that Nazarick would end up in shambles if he did any more than minimum work.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">But this idea ended in failure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The denizens of Nazarick ended up thinking that they had to work even harder to make up for him as it was natural for Ainz to not have to work.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">As a result, Ainz’s already meager workload, which mainly consisted of just approving things, was reduced even further.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was probably for the best. There would be disastrous consequences for Nazarick if the less-than-competent Ainz took over a larger share of the workload, but the fact that the others had to work more as a result was something that he did feel bad about.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Haa…</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz took a glance from the corner of his eye at the pair of maids who were staring at him unblinking, with stern expressions, and fire in their eyes. One was waiting on Ainz for the day and the other was assigned to his room; both of them would immediately ask “is there anything I can do to assist you?” if he met their eyes. To avoid such an encounter, he could only take peeks like this.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They don’t have to take things so seriously… I wish they’d relax a bit… This tense atmosphere is making my stomach cramp up…</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz tried to remember the last time he saw the maids smile. Mentally sighing one last time, he called on the maids standing by his side.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“…Well then, Lumière.” “Yes, Ainz-sama?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Just to confirm, was that the last of my work for the day?” “Yes, Ainz-sama. That was the last of it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The reason he asked the maid attending him was because secretarial tasks were being handled by the regular maids during Albedo’s absence.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It seemed as though there were no audiences or negotiations in today’s schedule. Even so, work has a tendency to crop up unexpectedly so he couldn’t let his guard down. His caution was warranted, as the unplanned work that might emerge in the wake of a [Message] from Entoma tended to be the troublesome type that ends up making his non-existent stomach churn.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Is that so…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz looked at the other desk in his room.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even though the desk had been set up at Albedo’s insistence, she was not there now.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Most of the time Albedo worked side-by-side with Ainz in this room, but it had only been a few days since the fall of the Royal capital, so she was quite busy at the moment. She could be seen running around Nazarick and sometimes traveling afar to deal with the issue in person, so her presence here was rare.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Upon questioning the maids about Albedo’s status when he wasn’t around, Ainz found out that she had been on edge recently. Maybe it was because she was overworked, or maybe it was because she wasn’t able to meet with him as often as she’d like.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">If it’s the latter, maybe it would be best if I increase the time she spends with me</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">There was no reason to deny her wish if that was enough to get her back in high spirits.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“……”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Because no one would speak if Ainz did not, the room fell into complete silence. Truth be told, Ainz wanted the kind of workplace that was filled with idle chatter, but his experience over these past few years told him that there was no way the maids would participate in such a thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">So lonely.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It seems like this is going to continue for the rest of my life… Well, there’s nothing to be done about it. However, maybe there’s a need for a change of environment.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Normally Ainz would spend his free time on many different activities.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Equestrianship. Reading books on business under the guise of reading scholarly works. Also books on governance — the reason none of that material managed to stick in his mind was probably because he only ever skimmed through them. It’s certainly not because his skull was empty.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He would also conduct various magical experiments.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Recently, he had also started training under Pandora’s Actor, in addition to his arms training under Cocytus.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Now then…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He spoke as though he was talking to himself, while letting his words reach the entire room — this was done on purpose.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was time to start taking action.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The plan he would soon commence was to help Aura and Mare make some friends. The first step was to make preparations toward this end. As for what kind of friends they should make, Dark Elves would be his number one choice. Following that should be members of closely related races like Elves. Though he was expecting a future where all races lived in peaceful coexistence, introducing them out of the blue to Lizardmen or Goblins — as their first friends — was not a good idea.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">First, they should proceed with similar races. He looked at Lumière.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“…We will move to the Sixth Floor. Attend me.” “Understood.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Although she would follow along even if he had stayed silent, Ainz felt that it was probably better to say it out loud.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">With Lumière in tow, Ainz teleported to the Sixth Floor using the power of his Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown. If he had ordered Lumière to bring the people he wanted to meet to his room, she would have done so. As the supreme ruler of Nazarick, it probably would be more suitable to call over the people in question.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">However, he did not do so because he wanted matters to proceed amicably. For that reason, it would be better if Ainz went in person to express his sincerity.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They would probably feel a sense of intimacy and respect if he went to them instead of rudely demanding their attendance. If the fact that the ruler of this land specially appearing before them could put the right amount of pressure on them, it would be even better.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The people he wanted to meet were the three elves that were captured when those Workers intruded into Nazarick.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">…We should have questioned those elves in detail when we moved them to the Sixth Floor… Well, we couldn’t back then.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A few years had passed since then, and while some basic information had been gathered about their circumstances, they had not been asked questions about the Elven country or any personal information. That was because Ainz wanted to maintain his position as the friendly undead who had saved the elves from their slavemaster’s tyranny. If he had drilled them for specifics about the location of their homes or about the Elven race, they might have suspected that he had ulterior motives and so he wouldn’t have been able to preserve his image.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But wouldn’t it be the same if they were to be asked those questions now? Not really.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The situation now was different from when they were just the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. It wouldn’t be suspicious at all if Nazarick—the Sorcerer Kingdom of Ainz Ooal Gown, which had brought many races under its reign, wished to gain information on the Elven country to open diplomatic relations.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Now I have a suitable excuse for everything I wanted to ask them, plus I don’t think the twins are the kind to have bullied them… It would be great if they completely opened their hearts to me, but I should temper my expectations. I would have given better orders back then, if only I could have thought this far ahead…</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even as he thought about this, Ainz disliked the idea of Aura and Mare having to treat those elves with feigned kindness on his orders. Though if it was Demiurge or Albedo he wouldn’t have given a second thought.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As with the earlier comparison between the regular maids and Cocytus’ vassals, it was not good to let one’s judgment be influenced by appearances. However, Ainz could not rid himself of his bias, probably because he was just an ordinary person.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">With Lumière following, Ainz walked down the dimly lit corridor. A large</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">portcullis loomed ahead with sunlight spilling in through the latticed gratings.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Further ahead was the circular arena on the Sixth Floor.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It was possible to directly teleport to the twins’ residence using his Ring, but he chose not to because—</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—As if it was an automatic door, the portcullis quickly rose up. Ainz suddenly had a sense of déjà vu. He had visited them in the same way on his first day in this world, when he also met the small figure standing before him now.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“Welcome Ainz-sama, we have been waiting for you!” The energetic voice of a young girl welcomed him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“Umm. I have some business to attend to, Aura — I will be relying on you.” He was fortunate that Aura was the one on guard duty today.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As the Sorcerer Kingdom expanded, the Floor Guardians ended up taking on a wider range of duties; as a result, they often had to operate outside of Nazarick. But, at any given time two or three of the following Floor Guardians: Albedo, Demiurge, Aura, Mare, Cocytus, and Shalltear, must remain within Nazarick.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Usually, it was the trio Albedo, Cocytus, and Shalltear, but sometimes Cocytus had to attend to the Lizardmen village and Shalltear had to take care of the dragons.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">During such times, the others would stay behind. This system was not developed on Ainz’s orders.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There was a time when Ainz had considered making Cocytus responsible for the defense of Nazarick and designating Shalltear as his assistant, but the size of the domains they managed was much different now. So, Ainz thought it would be fine if the others headed out as long as they left at least one of the Guardians behind.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">That said, he felt hesitant about telling that to the Guardians.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was because Ainz was afraid that as an absolute ruler, his opinion would end up taking precedence over the independent thoughts and actions of the Guardians. He wanted to respect their autonomy.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Additionally, Ainz’s opinions were probably meaningless anyway when Albedo and Demiurge, who were both far more intelligent than Ainz, were in agreement. A Guardian’s ideas would certainly be better than Ainz’s with his below-average intellect.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Okay! I understand, Ainz-sama. So what brings you here today?” “—Umu.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ainz gave a solemn response to the smiling Aura. To be honest, there was no</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">need to be so solemn just now. The usual “Umu” spoken in a regal manner would have sufficed. However, he ended up responding in a heavy tone as he thought about whether things would go smoothly from here on out.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It ended up having quite an effect on Aura, as her expression turned serious in an instant.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was bad, it was definitely going to cause another misunderstanding. “Fu—,” Ainz nearly swore out loud. He would not be able to keep his act up if</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">they noticed that something was wrong. He was confident that if he was pressed on it, his act would break down and he could do nothing but ad-lib his way out.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Furst, yes, first of all, I came here to meet the elves.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Just to make sure, would I be right to assume you are speaking of those elf prisoners?”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Sorry. As I thought, I shouldn’t have covered it up in such an awkward way… please don’t look at me with such sincere eyes… I want to see that smile from before…</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“…It’s just as you have said. I want to know what they are doing now, and then I want to ask them some things to prepare for the next step.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Understood. Then I will bring them here.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz knew that this would happen. Or rather, that any denizen of Nazarick would probably respond the same way as Aura did now. That’s why Ainz continued with the explanation he had prepared beforehand — although it was more of a deception than an explanation.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“N-no, there is no need for that. Because I am here to achieve two objectives.” “…Two objectives, is it? Ainz-sama has considered so many things just for a</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">meeting with prisoners, I see…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She looked at Ainz with eyes full of admiration. Ainz looked away, unable to say that he had just prepared in advance for possible arguments from Aura and Mare. “My first objective is to put pressure on them by directly approaching them. The other objective… is not directly related to elves, but all sorts of creatures have been moved to the Sixth Floor after we brought the Great Forest of Tob completely under our control. I thought I should see how things have turned out with my own eyes. How about it, Aura? I would like you to show me around the place that has changed the most, if you don’t mind.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Basically, management of the Floors was left to their respective Guardians, with Ainz rarely intervening. Therefore, Ainz had never gotten the chance to examine the changes firsthand. That was proof of the trust Ainz had placed on the Guardians. If a subordinate’s work was going well, a superior butting in could</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">only be considered a nuisance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Since he was already going through the trouble of visiting the elves, he thought he might as well take a look. He didn’t know how Aura interpreted it but the air around her suddenly became more tense.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“—Understood. So the ‘First’ was about this.” Aura replied with a strained expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“And there’s no need for the ‘if you don’t mind’ Ainz-sama! Ainz-sama is the absolute ruler of Nazarick. You do not need a Guardian’s permission wherever you may choose to go!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Eh…? Umm, umu. I’m grateful to hear you say so.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“To say that you’re grateful… Well, in that case, I think the Field of Flowers is the area with the most changes, so please let me guide you there.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Field of Flowers—”Ainz searched through his memories. “It’s the place where some of the plant-type monsters were moved, right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Yes, that’s correct. Then there’s the segregated area where we have relocated the non-intelligent plant-type monsters, and an area inhabited by the intelligent plant-type monsters, some of whom have settled in the village we built a while back and are living like humans do. Would you like to proceed there?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That village had been constructed inside of Nazarick in case they met other Players in the future, to show that Nazarick was capable of coexisting peacefully with humans. While it comprised several small houses and fields of crops, it was difficult to call something of that scale a village.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But as there was no other suitable word for it, it ended up being called a village nevertheless.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Does Ainz-sama remember the dryad called Pinison?” “…Yes, I remember them well.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was mostly a lie, or more accurately, he could not remember their face or other such details, only a vague silhouette. So he did in fact remember someone like that. As the fight that occurred shortly after meeting them had left a stronger impression, they were more like an adjunct memory in comparison. Frankly put, Ainz was not good at remembering things like people’s names or faces. He was the type to write down his impression of the person he just met on the back of their business card.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“That one is now something like a village chief.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Hearing more from Aura, it seemed as though the plant-type monsters were a capricious lot and the title of village head was just a self-proclaimed position. But</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">having acted as an intermediary between the plant-type monsters that first came to Nazarick and other plant-type monsters, it had become moderately popular. You could say it was the representative for the plant-type monsters that came from the outside.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There were some plant-type monsters that were stronger than Pinison and tended not to listen to it, but with Aura and Mare’s support there hadn’t been any problems so far.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The plant-type monsters arriving in Nazarick had all received Aura and Mare’s welcome. This “Welcome” consisted of a demonstration of Aura’s and Mare’s strength, as well as a display of the host of other monsters that followed them. After having realized the difference between their respective strengths, most of the monsters would end up obediently following the twins’ orders.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Also,  when  the  monsters  saw  the  cash  shop  Woodland  Dragons  that accompanied Mare, they seemed to be in awe of him, wondering if he was a god. The final nail in that coffin was when they saw him create rain and increase the nutritional levels of the soil to frightening levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“But I don’t think all the monsters worship him as a god. Maybe it’s because some monsters recognize the events as the work of druidic magic. If I had to explain it, he is more like an existence to be extolled…”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Hmm, <span class="p">Aura pondered.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz more or less understood. It would be something akin to praising a Player as a “god” for creating an awesome-looking set of gear. Or maybe it was something like being an idol. Perhaps it was a mixture of the two.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—I see, I understand the gist of it. Anyhow, if you two are able to subjugate them without any problems then that’s fine. There should be no issues with whatever means or methods you may employ— …ah, umm. That’s that.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz was now regretting his choice of words when they were managing just fine. Instead of blathering meaningless words at length, he should have just praised them honestly with a simple “Well done.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He stole a quick glance at Aura’s expression, and it didn’t seem like she was particularly bothered. But maybe she was just not letting it show on her face.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Superiors should not use words that can demoralize their subordinates, haven’t I read that in some of those books on management…?</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz gave himself a mental admonition to take more care when choosing his words. And to keep tone and manner of speech in mind as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“…Ahem. I would like to see the village but let’s just keep it to the Field of</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Flowers this time. I apologize for that, especially after you went through the trouble of suggesting something specific.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aura waved her hands about in distress.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“P-please don’t mind! As I said before, Ainz-sama is the absolute ruler of Nazarick! Please proceed through this Floor as you please, Ainz-sama. Please let me apologize for my arrogance in proposing such a suggestion!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“N-no need…”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">…Why are you apologizing? Or rather… Isn’t that an odd reaction from Aura, not unlike her reaction a little while ago? Is it possible that my attempt to gloss over my mistake when we first met has resulted in this weird reaction? Does she think that I’m plotting something?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Aura’s words didn’t wait for the unsettled Ainz.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“There exists no place in Nazarick where Ainz-sama should be denied entrance— No, no such place should exist within the entirety of this world!”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">No, I think there are many places in this world that I shouldn’t be entering, <span class="p">Ainz thought. Notably, there were many places where he thought only women should be allowed to enter, but if he voiced such an opinion then Aura would assuredly reply that it was fine for Ainz to enter regardless. So he didn’t reply, as it would quickly turn into an awkward situation (for Ainz at least) if he did.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Taking a quick peek at Lumière revealed that she was nodding along as if to say that was how it should be. Whatever, it was bothersome to come up with reasons for why that wasn’t the case.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Taking care to not let such inner feelings show, Ainz spoke gently to Aura. “Well, then please show me the way.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Understood! Leave it to me.” Aura thumped her chest. “So— how should we travel? Would you like to ride something?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“That’s acceptable. May I impose on you?” “Yes! Please leave it to me!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Aura shifted her gaze to somewhere far away and wrinkled her brows in concentration for a few seconds.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“There are other magical beasts nearby but I decided to call over Fen and Quadracile. Is that alright?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“You don’t need my approval for each and every thing you do here. If Aura deems something acceptable, then I have no objections.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Thank you. Please wait for a bit” “Aah, then I’ll be in your care.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz replied as he looked around the arena.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The most enjoyable walks in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick — such an activity elicited a different kind of joy than the sort of entertainment available on the Ninth and Tenth Floors — could be found on the Fifth and Sixth Floors. Although it was extremely rare, if the timing was right one could see a luminescent phenomenon known as an Aurora on the Fifth Floor. Unfortunately, it seemed that the probability of its appearance was set very low. In contrast, the Sixth Floor was a place that was entertaining enough for a normal walk. They were about to travel through such a Floor.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz gave a small smile as he felt his stomach ease a little.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 204pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♦ ♦ ♦</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Excusing herself, Aura stepped away from her Master and Lumière to take out a necklace. This necklace was a legacy class item that allowed for two-way communication with its pair. Although it was a relatively weak item, she always kept it equipped because the item’s ability was inaccessible to the user unless it had been continuously equipped for two days. Usually items with such special conditions tended to be strong, but that was not the case for this necklace. Moreover, since a condition for the necklace’s usage was that the speaker must hold it in hand, it was difficult to use during tough battles.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But those limitations mentioned above are the item’s only usage restrictions, and it does allow for indefinite two-way communication. It was debatable whether such an item was good enough to warrant taking up an equipment slot.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Mare, Ainz-sama came to visit.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a short silence, Mare’s voice echoed in her head.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="s34">「</span>Eh, eh? Ainz-sama came here in person? What’s going on?<span class="s34">」</span>”</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">What else could it be? It’s an inspection, an inspection!”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">Eeeh!?</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Probably to check if we and the Area Guardians are properly managing this Floor. …He decided to inspect only the recently altered Field of Flowers for now… but we should double-check that the Area Guardians are not slacking off right now.”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">Is it because… this Floor is the one with the most outsiders? Or is he just visiting each Floor in turn?</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—<span class="p">Ahh, maybe that’s the case.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Something clicked into place inside of Aura’s mind. Of course, it could have been nothing more than Aura’s own imagination, but she thought that Mare was probably right.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Ainz-sama said he had two objectives in mind but this is Ainz-sama we are talking about… I don’t think that it’s just those two. Maybe putting some pressure on us like this was his unspoken third objective.”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 124%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">Aah… Maybe he is confirming that we are handling our most important and fundamental responsibilities diligently even though our work outside has greatly increased?</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They had a vague idea as to why he was doing this.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Those who had once envied Albedo and Demiurge for their packed schedules</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">— for example, Shalltear and Cocytus — were now increasingly being assigned work outside of Nazarick. They had been given the opportunity to demonstrate their loyalty with their extraordinary military accomplishments, especially during the destruction of the Kingdom. Perhaps their master had noticed the kind of festive mood this had created.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">No matter what auxiliary duties they may have been conferred, Aura and the others were first and foremost Floor Guardians of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick. They had the absolute and unchanging duty of defending, managing, and controlling the Floors that they had been assigned. Maybe Ainz wanted to make sure they were not neglecting their most fundamental duties in light of their increasing engagement with their newly assigned duties.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">For Aura and Mare, receiving a dissatisfactory rating directly from their master was the same as saying they had failed as Floor Guardians. If the other Floor Guardians — especially the Guardian Overseer Albedo — heard of this, they would surely reprimand the twins while staring daggers at them. The fact that their master had not told them directly was probably an act of kindness.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: right;">“<span class="p">Maybe he anticipates that we will spread the word of our inspection to the other Floor Guardians, which would motivate them to get their affairs in order…” </span>“<span class="s34">「</span><span class="p">That’s possible. In that case, that might be his fourth objective? I’m sure</span></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">that there must be something more…<span class="s34">」</span>”</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura couldn’t think of anything more. The same went for Mare. It was a little frustrating for them to think that Demiurge or Albedo would surely be able to anticipate Ainz’s goals much more accurately than they could.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Anyhow, let’s make preparations.”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">…Eh? Make preparations?</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Ah, sorry. I haven’t told you yet. Didn’t I say earlier that Ainz had two objectives? The first was the inspection and the second was to meet with the elves that were assigned to those vacant rooms.”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 118%;text-align: justify;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">Ah, those people… They are so noisy, always going ‘royal family this, royal family that.’ I hope Ainz-sama takes them away.</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Mare spoke with a hint of annoyance in his voice.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Mare, whose favorite pastime was lounging about on his futon, seemed to be regarded by those three as someone that was incapable of properly taking care of himself, and so they ended up trying to care for him many more times over than they did for Aura. This included hanging up his futon to dry, helping him get dressed, and sometimes even attempting to bathe him. This was quite too much for Mare, but as he had been entrusted with their wellbeing by his master’s orders, he couldn’t just bluntly refuse their efforts at caretaking.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“—<span class="p">Ah, Fen and Quadracile are close by. I don’t know how long it will take for them to get here, but make preparations immediately, Mare.”</span></p><p class="s34" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><span class="s35">“</span>「<span class="p">Um. Leave it to me.</span>」<span class="p">”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aura cut the connection with Mare and returned back to her master.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 204pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♦ ♦ ♦</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If any invaders having experienced the horrors of Nazarick were to gaze upon the Field of Flowers with its myriad flowers in bloom on the Sixth Floor, they would probably think that it was concealment for some flower-mimicking monster or a deadly trap. But, there was no such thing here in this place.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Even though the place invited extreme suspicion, the fact of the matter was that there were no traps here awaiting the intruders.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There existed flower-mimicking plant and insectoid monsters in YGGDRASIL, but no such monsters were placed here. Furthermore, there wasn’t even an Area Guardian stationed here, unlike what was usually the case with such areas.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">This place, which could be considered to be under Aura and Mare’s direct supervision, was really just a beautiful flower field.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Certainly, there had been plans to turn it into a trap.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There was no way that any intruders that managed to reach the Sixth Floor</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">would regard this place to be a mere flower field. They would either be wary and hesitant to approach or they would take the initiative and burn it away with fire- based attacks that possessed secondary effects. As a countermeasure for such an occasion, there were talks of growing plants that would disperse lethal poison or a paralyzing agent when stimulated by fire. However, the three female members of the guild vehemently opposed such an idea, and so the plan was reworked. The result was this unassuming field of flowers.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That was how Ainz remembered the Field of Flowers, but the field looked different now.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Buds large enough to encompass an entire person rose out of the Field of Flowers. There were twelve of them. A single glance was enough to find them suspect — or rather, one would be certain that there was definitely something suspicious going on.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz examined his memories.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">There were many monsters in this world that Ainz did not know of, but Ainz was sure that a similar monster had existed in YGGDRASIL.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A recollection flashed through his mind like a shooting star.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Am I correct in thinking that’s an Alraune?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Yes! That’s correct!”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They were not originally placed in Nazarick nor were they among those summoned after Nazarick’s arrival in this world. There was no doubt that they were a foreign species — one of those brought from the Great Forest of Tob.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">In the center of the Field of Flowers, there was a shovel stuck firmly into the ground. This was a divine class item named Earth Recover.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Earth Recover was a divine class item with ridiculously high durability, but on the other hand its offensive capabilities were extremely low. That was because most of its data capacity was dedicated to secondary abilities.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Also in the Field of Flowers was a magical beast resembling a giant angora rabbit — a Spear Needle. The idyllic scene of it sitting in the middle of the Field of Flowers munching on a giant carrot had a fairy-tale-like charm, but that was probably not the reason why it was placed here.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">While Ainz couldn’t confirm his suspicions without asking Aura, he strongly suspected that it was here as a warden.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Despite its appearances, it was still a creature whose level was in the high 60s. Whatever the alraunes might get up to, there was no doubt that it could easily</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">annihilate them should the need arise.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">By the way, the carrot that the child over there is gnawing on was gathered from the farm. Pinison and the other plant-type monsters used their respective powers to give it large amounts of nutrients, which transformed it from a normal carrot into that giant thing.”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Not nurtured but transformed? Is it safe to let it eat that then? Though weak poisons would have no effect on something of that level…”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 128%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">It’s not poisonous. I checked with the Head Chef and he gave it passing marks as an ingredient. Regrettably, it doesn’t provide any buffing effects unlike the materials that were originally stored in Nazarick. It has simply grown bigger and sweeter.”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">That’s a great success as a foodstuff, isn’t it? Can the ordinary farmers of the Sorcerer Kingdom cultivate it?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 129%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">It’s impossible. At present, it’s difficult to grow them in large quantities even with the help of the plant-type monsters. Even if we use the power of Earth Recover, it seems that just one of them can suck up a considerable amount of the soil’s nutrients</span>… <span class="p">it won’t go so far as turning the land into a desert, but unless we use magic to recover the soil’s nutrients, the fields would need to be left fallow for at least a year…”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">As Ainz and the others looked over the field, one of the buds — the largest one</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">— slowly unfurled.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">That’s the Alraune Lord. It’s in charge of all fourteen alraunes here.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Aura introduced it briskly. There was no doubt she was talking about the Alraune that was opening up.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Fourteen?” Ainz quickly asked, sneakily recounting the number of Alraunes. “Not twelve?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Yes. The other two were recently born and are hiding by the flowers. Should I drag them out?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“…<span class="p">No, there’s no need for that.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Born inside Nazarick, would it be counted as one of Nazarick’s monsters? Or was it different? What were its abilities? Many questions came to his mind, but before he could ask Aura the bud had finished blooming.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As he had expected, inside was a feminine-looking monster. Rather, it looked very similar to some monsters he had seen in YGGDRASIL. For something named as a Lord of its kind, not much was different about it except for its size.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Its hair and eyes were the same color as the petals of its flower, and its entire body was green, the same color as its stalk. It was not wearing any clothes, but since its skin seemed to be formed from an amalgam of thin stems, it looked rather uncanny.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: right;">The features that were probably eyes were slanted upwards and didn’t look friendly at all. It gave the impression that the owner of those eyes was irritated.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Suddenly, Ainz felt a brief pang of nostalgia. It reminded him of a certain girl from the Holy Kingdom with a pair of fierce-looking eyes.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz wasn’t one to remember faces easily, but those eyes were something that left a deep impression on him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The monster’s expression warped into something wicked.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Good morning Aura-sama. On behalf of the green races, I give you thanks for the wonderful sunlight we have received today.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There was no hostility in that crystal clear voice. On the contrary, Ainz could even sense some respect. It seemed that the smile from before was just a sincere expression of welcome, though even now he couldn’t help but feel that it was plotting something behind that smile.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The other alraunes rustled their petals, but it didn’t look like they planned to open up. However, they could be seen stealing glances at Ainz, their heads unable to be completely obscured by their petals.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Not knowing what that behavior signified, it could not be said that they were being impolite. Perhaps this was an expression of utmost respect in Alraune culture.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">And so—”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Alraune Lord turned its gaze towards Ainz.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 129%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">This is the ruler of the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick, the king among kings who completely dominates not only that forest but also this entire area, who founded the Sorcerer Kingdom where many diverse races may live together in peace. The absolute ruler, His Majesty, the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown!”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After Aura proudly announced Ainz’s presence, the Alraune Lord’s face turned even more wicked. The petals of the other Alraunes trembled and they slowly started to hide their faces. Was this because they were alarmed or afraid? Or maybe this was a sign of great admiration?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t be sure from their expressions alone, but Ainz felt like it was</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">probably the latter.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">I-it’s an honor to receive your grace, sovereign of this land, the ruler of the Sorcerer Kingdom, and above all, the master of Mare-sama and Aura-sama, Your Majesty, the Sorcerer King Ainz Ooal Gown.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Her wide open arms were probably a form of greeting.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">I am named Violet. I am pleased to make your acquaintance.”</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Oi, isn’t that just the color of your hair? <span class="p">Ainz thought.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 132%;text-align: right;">To put it simply, it was a straightforward name with little thought put into it. Not that this was something that Ainz could say out loud. Making fun of a name that had (probably) been given to it by its parents to its face was not a good idea. <span class="s35">“</span>Umm. I will remember it. Anyhow, this land is entrusted to Aura and Mare.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: right;">It is unlikely that there will ever be a situation in which you receive direct</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">instruction from me. You should continue to act in accordance with the twins’ orders.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He ended his sentence with vague words because he did not know how the twins were managing these alraunes. Ainz had experienced for himself the troubles that could crop up when the CEO and department head gave conflicting orders.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In the first place, he didn’t have anything of value to say because he didn’t know what work the Alraunes had been given or how they were being handled.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Understood, Your Majesty the Sorcerer King.”</span></p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Isn’t its etiquette amazing for someone who is supposed to have lived in the forest? <span class="p">Ainz praised the monster’s sense of propriety. </span>When and where did it gain this knowledge? Was she trained by the twins? Or somewhere else—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—Or though how it was speaking might carry such nuance, perhaps in actuality it was speaking in a more Alraune-esque manner? For example, it could be saying something like “Ainz is a very big bud.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">(T/N: Ainz seems to be considering whether auto-translate shenanigans are at play here.)</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was good that they could communicate with each other, but Ainz wondered whether this disconnect might create any problems. Well, it wasn’t like he really cared about being called a big bud anyway.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">And so, Ainz looked around the Field of Flowers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He thought that the Alraunes were obstructing the view a bit, but at least everything else was still as he remembered. With a barely discernible smile —</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">though his face didn’t move of course — he briskly turned around, trying to look as stylish as possible as he twirled his robe. Aura’s pet Fenrir and Itzamna were waiting for him there, along with Lumière.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After he started walking, Aura quickly fell in step and inquired, “Is it fine to leave it at just that? Will you grant an audience to the other alraunes?”</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">No, that won’t be necessary. I saw what I wanted to see. Now, can you take me to those elves?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Understood.”Aura replied, and together with Aura, Ainz rode Fen through the Sixth Floor.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Soon they were nearing their destination. Looking up, they could see the slightly misshapen tree that was Aura’s and Mare’s residence peeking through the branches of the tall trees.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After a few seconds, they were clear of the forest and a meadow spread out ahead of them. In the center of the meadow stood a stout tree, wider than it was tall, with its overgrown branches casting shadows across the ground.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Standing before an opening in the trunk of the tree was Mare and the three elves that waited on him. There was no doubt they were there to welcome Ainz. He didn’t know when Aura had found the time to contact Mare, but if it had been immediately after he had arrived on the floor, he might have kept them waiting for quite a while.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It wasn’t like he had promised to meet them at a fixed time, so Ainz didn’t have any reason to feel guilty.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">But, well…</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Suppose that Ainz was a branch manager and got a call that the CEO traveling all the way from headquarters had just arrived at the nearest railway station. He too would have immediately gone out to wait in front of the branch office. It was inconceivable that he wouldn’t prepare a welcome. With that thought in mind, it could be said that Ainz was at fault for not giving them the exact time he would be coming over.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz wanted to say that he was not at fault because he hadn’t thought of that point until he had already arrived, but could that really be considered a legitimate excuse? He wasn’t sure how long they had waited for him, but he knew that if he said “You didn’t have to wait for me,” he would have nothing to say in response to the rebuke that he should be more mindful of others’ feelings and the position they were in.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Mare was in his usual outfit while the elves were wearing plain fatigues (which some may consider to be enough for them). Ainz would have preferred if they were better dressed, but since Aura and Mare had decided that it was good enough, that was not something he could say.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Also—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Lumière and the other maids would probably be displeased if the elves were to wear maid uniforms.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The regular maids were quite proud of the fact that they served Ainz. He had heard from Sebas that while maid candidates from the outside would not be bullied directly, they would be indirectly bullied by not being taught how to properly perform their duties and so on.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They probably wouldn’t mind much in this case since the elves acted the part of maids serving Aura and Mare, but he couldn’t be 100% sure. Besides, they might not like the elves wearing the same uniform as them. The maids think of their uniform as battle gear.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The Fenrir arrived before the four people waiting there.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Thank you for coming out here to welcome me. I am very pleased with the depth of your loyalty.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Before dismounting the Fenrir, Ainz took the initiative to speak first. He had considered waiting until Mare had greeted him first, but decided that this approach would leave a better impression.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Th-thank you very much.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Smiling, Mare bowed his head, with the three elves quickly following suit.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Good!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz pumped his fist mentally at the apparent good start he made and looked at the elves after they raised their heads.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">All of their faces—no, their entire bodies look stiff. The elves gulped as they received Ainz’s stare.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Whichever way you looked at it, all of them were too tense. The question was whether it was caused by fear or something else. In other words, whether this was the fear of imminent death for appearing irreverent or the tension one felt when they met a famous person.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Just in case, Ainz checked if he was releasing his aura. He was not projecting any hostility or killing intent towards the elves so that shouldn’t be the cause of their fear.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This is unexpectedly troublesome, though it went smoothly until now…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Opponents tended to be sensitive to the emotions of strong beings like Ainz and end up getting dominated by fear. In a certain sense, this was like getting read by the opponent, so he also received various pointers during training with Cocytus to prevent this. On the other hand, Ainz himself couldn’t sense the killing intent of others.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He forced Cocytus, who loathed the idea, to direct killing intent towards him and did end up feeling some pressure. However, he was not sure if that was the thing known as killing intent. Perhaps the undead were just not good at sensing those kinds of things.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The undead were completely immune against mental effects, so perhaps sensing killing intent could be counted as a mental effect in a broad sense.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That said, Shalltear could sense it just fine. Cocytus said “Maybe. Increasing. One’s. Ability. As. A. Warrior. Makes. It. Easier. To. Sense. Such. Emotion”. Ainz thought to himself that he should probably include learning the ability to sense such emotions as one of his future goals. Perhaps it was just that Ainz was too thick-skulled to sense such emotions.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">oops—too many pointless thoughts</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Mare started speaking at the same time Ainz started collecting himself together.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">U-umm, y-you see, about Ainz-sama w-wanting to meet w-with these e-elves today, is something the matter?”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Although Mare was more timid than usual, it seems like he had already heard the details from Aura. This made things easier.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz shifted his gaze from Mare to the elves with an exaggerated movement. The elves turned to look at their feet like they were trying to escape his gaze. They were visibly trembling.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">However you looked at it, this was not born from being tense.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This is probably from fear. Are they still on guard even though they have been subordinated to a pair of dark elf children? Honestly, after pledging their loyalty and living here in peace all this time as the living, it would have been great if they understood that this undead is different from the ones they knew… Well, my appearance is like this. Even if their minds understood, it would be difficult for their hearts to accept</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In this world, the undead were said to hate the living and were considered to be the enemy of all living beings. So it was only natural for these elves to be on guard and tremble in fear at the undead being in front of them.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Maybe their reaction would have been different if they lived under Shalltear and got used to the undead, but there were barely any undead on the Sixth Floor, so there was nothing they could do about this.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—Seeing something once is more effective than hearing about it a hundred times after all</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was the same in YGGDRASIL. Techniques categorized as Player skills were easier to understand by seeing them directly in contrast to just getting a verbal explanation. Of course, he also needed to practice it a few times—no, hundreds of times later to learn it himself.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“—<span class="p">Yes, that’s right Mare. I want to ask one…yes, one simple question of those behind you.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Elves started to breathe shallower and faster.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They didn’t need to be so afraid, Ainz wanted to say from the bottom of his heart. Of course, he couldn’t just say, “nothing to fear~” in a cheery voice. He couldn’t break his character of Nazarick’s ruler, Ainz Ooal Gown, but it would be troublesome if they didn’t feel at ease.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“…<span class="p">you don’t have to worry so much. I didn’t come here to harm you.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wanted to continue with “so be at ease”, but stopped after thinking that even he wouldn’t believe it if told so by a fearsome being. Even if the CEO invited them to an informal gathering, he would doubt there would be any employee who would ignore their status that easily.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Haa. Bothersome…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">While he knew it would be a bad move, he suddenly felt like casting [Dominate]. It was because he was not confident he could cajole them or make them feel at ease.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One would remember what they said and did even after said magic ended. Furthermore, the use of mind control magic is considered barbaric in other countries.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t know how elves saw it, but they certainly would not find it to be pleasant.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In fact, if someone did that to anyone from Nazarick, even Ainz would wait for an opportunity to kill them.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Of course, Ainz wouldn’t hesitate to use it to gather important intelligence. If anything he would even be willing to cast [Control Amnesia] without a doubt.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">But, there’s no need to go that far in the present scenario. It’s not like he was</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">sure they did something bad or was hiding information from him.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—Zen, beru? It was different back then. If I use magic to get information that I could easily get by talking to them, it would cast doubts on Aura’s and Mare’s abilities</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The twins, no, everyone in the Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick had undying loyalty towards Ainz, they believed that whatever he did would be correct (which was a dangerous way of thought in his opinion)</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That’s why he should not try to give the impression that he was dissatisfied with their work as much as possible. He could not fathom what such a misunderstanding could lead to, plus it’s not like he was dissatisfied with their work.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If he was going to use mind control magic, he should have done that in the first place.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t do that when they were initially captured because he wanted to make them allies through goodwill—he wanted to position himself as their savior. Considering such an investment was placed in them up till this point, using mind control magic to force them would be short-sighted.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“—<span class="p">um. First of all, this isn’t the place to have a conversation. Let’s move elsewhere.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">If he was not confident in opening their hearts through words, he could just use a different method. First, a change of place.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">In that case, let’s go upstairs!” </span>“<span class="p">Y-yes! Please do that!” </span>“<span class="p">Aa—”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Ainz turned his gaze upwards—towards the giant tree. How was this place as the venue for their conversation?</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In a certain sense you could call this the elves’ home turf, so wouldn’t it be easier for them to talk here? But if they did that, who was going to prepare the drinks? Would it be Aura and Mare? No, it wouldn’t be an issue if Lumière, who came along, did that.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Not bad. In the end, the only difference is whether the conversation would take place in a harmonious or tense atmosphere. Whether they would open their mouths out of goodwill, or out of pressure. Ummm, there’s not much time left. Weird, even though I have already prepared presentation material and simulated their questions and responses… like I did in the Dwarf Kingdom and the Holy Kingdom… Am I getting a bit out of touch lately?</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He was invited by the other side, so he should reply as soon as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, he would always end up overthinking in such situations.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">…Speaking of which, I never saw the regular maids providing the guests with drinks without orders. N-no, they did it… once… maybe</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There was no way they didn’t prepare the drinks. When Ainz ordered them before, they immediately provided a choice of drinks. So they were probably stored somewhere in Ainz’s room. The regular maids were working themselves hard every day to become the perfect maids. It was hard to think that they would forget or were just insensitive to such needs.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">So it meant they probably thought that since Ainz the ruler did not drink, then the others shouldn’t as well. It’s similar to how it was awkward for subordinates to take a drink when the CEO didn’t.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The correct way to do things would be to prepare drinks for Ainz (even though he couldn’t drink) and then on top of that provide them for others as well.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">I feel sorry for the guests we had until now…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He decided to talk about it with Pestonya later, as he was getting flustered that he was wasting too much brain power on things unrelated to this meeting.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Wait, that’s not what I should be thinking about now. I should be deciding on the place for our drinks. The twins would think that I don’t like having tea at their house if I wait any longer. That will be bad. But—!</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Troubled, Ainz looked around.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 5pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Ah!”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 133%;text-align: right;">Ainz suppressed his shoulders from twitching at Aura’s sudden vocalization. His mind was also forcibly cleared of excessive thoughts with this sudden scare. <span class="s35">“</span>Is Ainz-sama thinking of having the conversation somewhere else on the</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 13pt;text-align: justify;">Sixth Floor?”</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Mm, umm. That’s right. The weather is great so I was thinking maybe we should do it outdoors.”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 129%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">In that case, I will make preparations. We have parasols and a table with us! These were the things Bukubukuchagama-sama used when she had to converse with the other Supreme Beings! We can use them. There’s a vacant house in the village. Also, I haven’t shown it to Ainz-sama yet, but there’s a gazebo on this floor too!”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">I remember visiting it with everyone.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz suddenly remembered the time spent with his comrades talking about</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">meaningless things.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—I feel like I am remembering them less and less recently</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Perhaps it was because he stopped seeing his comrades’ shadows in the NPCs. It’s either because he was slowly forgetting about his former comrades or maybe he had started seeing the NPCs increasingly as independent entities. It would be fine if it was the latter case, but it would be sad if it turned out to be the former.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">All of Suzuki Satoru’s pleasant memories that shine even now were made with his former comrades.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">—That’s not it! These are not past memories! Ainz Ooal Gown is still here! It is still alive!</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz let out a sigh while his heart burned with emotions he could not describe.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He turned his gaze towards Aura and Mare.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">…Everyone… I wonder how they felt when those people left this place… No, they were still NPCs back then. If at that moment… oops</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He shook his head.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">His thoughts were going on too many tangents. He had to make sure this plan succeeded.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz took a look around, it seemed like no one noticed anything was weird with him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">They were probably thinking that he was musing on Aura’s proposal. Now was a good time to put a lid on his thoughts.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 127%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Well then… This floor is not bad but this is such a rare occasion, we may as well have our conversation somewhere else. Maybe it’s good to have them take a look at other places under our rule.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If he wanted to count on their goodwill, it would be better if it was in a place they were used to, but he just wanted to get away from here.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">In that case, what would be a good place? There were two options. One was E- Rantel. The other one was Nazarick’s Ninth floor.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">These elves would form a good impression if they were to see the various races coexisting in E-Rantel, but he couldn’t be sure that there wouldn’t be any problems. If something violent were to occur, like them being attacked, he had many ways to protect the elves and it would also help earn the elves’ trust. However, it would be troublesome if someone did something to give the elves a negative impression. For example, if someone were to put on an act and call the Sorcerer King the source of all their hardships.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As a part of the plan, maybe he could mind control some humans and have</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">them work in tandem, but it would just make the elves suspicious.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In the first place, Ainz was a source of fear in E-Rantel. Though there were people who admired him, they were in the minority. The ratio was something like 70 to 30 unfortunately. Therefore, it would be a bad idea if he were to let them see people in fear of him. Also, there was the danger of the elves getting the wrong idea that the various races in E-Rantel were brought there as slaves.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">With that in mind… As I thought, it should be the Ninth Floor. In that case, where on the Ninth Floor?</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Should it be Ainz’s room, counting it as practice for Lumière in providing refreshments?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz pondered.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Getting drinks in the CEO’s room or having drinks in a cafe. Which one will put him at ease if he was in their place?</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 126%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">There’s only one answer. There’s nothing else to think about. Let’s go to the Ninth Floor. There is the cafeteria. Let’s talk while having a light lunch—did you have your lunch yet?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">N-no, not yet”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">I see. Then the timing’s just right.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Actually, Ainz was also trying to loosen them up by having their stomachs filled.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He took some time getting here so he was worried that they had already finished their lunch. Well no, they were informed beforehand of his arrival. They couldn’t have had leeway to have lunch when they did not know the exact time he would reach them.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 122%;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Good. Then let’s have our talk while having lunch.” Ainz turned his gaze towards the elves. “How about that?”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 1pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elves started panicking, trying to push each other into being the one to give an answer. The one in the middle ended up replying, more as a result of her being pressured on both sides rather than her willingly standing up as their representative.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">Y-yes. If it’s fine with Aura-sama and Mare-sama.”</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was certainly not something he could decide on without asking the twins, Ainz thought, so he asked them as well.</p><p class="s35" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“<span class="p">If it’s no problem, I want to take them to the cafeteria. What do you think?</span></p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I want the both of you to come as well if possible.”</p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">It’s okay with us! Right, Mare?”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">Uh, nn. Ah, no, I mean yes. I am fine with it just as s-sister said.”</span></p><p class="s35" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 123%;text-align: left;">“<span class="p">That’s good. Well then—” Ainz looked at the elves. “I am going to open a [Gate].”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark11">2</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They first returned to the Sixth floor’s entrance with [Gate]. Then, Ainz sent a [Message] to Aureole to open a Gate to the Ninth Floor. Naturally, the gate between the Eighth and Ninth Floors worked without an issue. If that wasn’t the case, then it was highly likely the Ariadne system would be triggered.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There really was no need to take this roundabout way. Though he couldn’t teleport everyone there at once due to the capacity limit of the Ring of Ainz Ooal Gown, he could have just made the trip twice. It was Ainz’s cautious heart that made him go through all this trouble just to give the elves the wrong impression. The fact was that he was extremely reluctant about showing the ring’s abilities to others.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Cocytus’ subordinates, who were on guard duty, bowed their heads deeply at Ainz’s arrival.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—Thank you for your hard work.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz gave them a simple magnanimous greeting, befitting the aura of a ruler.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Following Aura and Lumière, the three elves came out from the Gate and bunched up together. They froze in their tracks the moment they saw the monsters bowing to Ainz.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was not like Cocytus’ vassals were being hostile toward them. That was a natural reaction, just like how a normal person walking through a forest would freeze if they saw a tiger suddenly appearing out of a bush.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">One of the elves was slightly pushed from behind.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As they froze before the gate, they were being a nuisance for Mare, who walked behind them. Even though he only pushed her lightly (probably controlling himself), it was fatal for the tense elf’s sense of balance.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Hiyee…” letting a pitiful cry, she collapsed onto the floor. Blood drained from</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">the other elves’ faces, and though they immediately tried to get her back up, the collapsed elf had trouble standing back up. It looked like she couldn’t force her legs to work.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Don’t be afraid. There’s no one who would lay a hand on you in Nazarick.” “Y-yes…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They probably didn’t doubt Ainz’s words, but even so, their tension wouldn’t let up. The elves by her side were quickly nodding their heads, their hair flying around from how hard they were nodding. As for the elf still on the floor, it seemed like she was on the brink of tears.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz could say with confidence that it would be problematic going forward if this continued. He had to make their hearts a bit more pliable at the very least.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Let’s head for someplace to take a short rest before heading to the cafeteria…[Gate]. Aura, pick her up.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Okay!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“N-no need for Aura-sama to do something like t…” “—It’s fine, It’s fine. Okay, let’s go.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: right;">Aura briskly lifted the collapsed elf, ignoring her pleas, and put her over her shoulder. Of course, as she wore work fatigues, there was no skirt to peek under.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The place connected by the [Gate]’s dark hemisphere was Ainz’s personal room.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">There were three bowing maids inside with cleaning equipment at their feet. “Good work everyone. I will leave soon after taking a short rest here. I don’t</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">mind if you continue with your work.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The maids replied in the affirmative and bowed again while the others came out from the [Gate].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elves started gawking at their surroundings with their mouths open, looking like idiots. It seemed like they found everything around them quite exotic, different from the twins’ home. They also looked less tense compared to before, probably because the regular maids were far more agreeable than Cocytus’s monster-like vassals.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Aura. Let her sit in that chair over there.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After Ainz pointed to Albedo’s chair, Aura quickly put the elf down on it. Albedo’s desk was spotless, just like her. By the way, Ainz’s desk was spotless too, albeit in a different sense of the word.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Th-thank you very much…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz tried to speak as gently as possible to the seated elf bowing her head, “no</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">need, I can understand your shock, but just as I said before, be at ease. No one in Nazarick would bring any harm to you, so I don’t mind if you take it easy.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Well, it’s not like they would suddenly feel at peace with just those words.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz turned his back towards the elves, went over to one of the maids, and issued an order to her quietly, “we will head to the cafeteria soon. Make sure that we will not meet anyone except you maids on our way there. Do the same thing in cafet…” -eria as well, he wanted to say, but did not. “No, nevermind. There’s no problem with the cafeteria being used as usual. Rather, it would be better if the others use it like normal.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Yes, understood. I will take my leave then.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Sorry for interrupting your work, but I’ll be relying on you.” “Such words are not needed, Ainz-sama.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He approached her because she was the maid nearest to him but seeing how she threw looks of victory at the other maids, it seemed she thought of it differently. Her colleagues frowned a bit at this with undeniable vexation.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The maid with orders turned her back to her colleagues and walked out of the room with a spring in her step.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz could sense (which should be rare for him as an undead) the other maids concentrating their gazes on his back. No doubt their eyes were filled with anticipation for any special kind of work that could be coming their way. By the way, he couldn’t perceive anything from Lumière, probably because being his maid-in-waiting for the day was special in itself.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It felt like he was sitting on needles (of course that wasn’t the intention of the maids), Ainz forced himself to look away from the maids and towards the elves.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He confirmed that their breaths had returned to normal.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“It seems like there are no more problems…let’s head out then”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">He didn’t want to rush them as he thought it would look forceful, but he didn’t want to stay here any longer.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">After he confirmed the elf could walk again, Ainz took the lead and left the room. The maids looking at him with chagrin could be ignored.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">While on the way to the cafeteria, he could sometimes hear the elves’ gasps of admiration from behind him, saying “amazing” and “beautiful”.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Ainz wanted to boast but he endured it and continued to walk ahead without looking behind him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">They eventually reached the cafeteria without meeting any other NPCs along the way. Except for the fact that it took more time than usual because of how</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">slow the gawking elves were—also because Ainz slowed down when they passed through the places he took special pride in—there were no other incidents.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Nazarick’s cafeteria was created with a company or a school’s cafeteria as its inspiration (of course, Ainz’s school or company did not have them so he didn’t know if that was really true), so the mood was a bit different from a restaurant.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was Ainz’s first visit here since the time when he visited all the establishments in Nazarick just after they first came to this world, but it looked like nothing had changed much. He could faintly hear young ladies engaging in animated conversations and the sound of cutlery from inside.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was probably filled with the regular maids and others who also worked on the Ninth Floor. Maybe there were Area Guardians present as well. It was a bit late for lunch but perhaps due to the shift system, it looked lively. If they could see the maids eating their lunch peacefully, the elves should understand what kind of place this was. They might feel like outsiders but still, this atmosphere of everyday life should calm them. That was why he did not order them to clear the cafeteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But the moment Ainz entered the room, the mood suddenly shifted. First, it turned completely silent.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: right;">The happy voices from before and the lively sounds of diners completely disappeared. The mood froze over, it was completely out of place for a cafeteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Then—Everyone turned to look at Ainz, their eyes wide open and their motions at a standstill.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">This was the feeling of being an outsider.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">As though he was a heteromorph with negative karma who just stepped into Alfheim.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—Don’t mind us. Continue with your lunch.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A few here and there, mostly the regular maids, started eating again upon hearing what Ainz said, but there was no indication that their conversations were going to start again. Everyone ate in silence.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Ainz did not want to interrupt their lunch at all. He started to feel a bit isolated but, well—on second thought, it’s not like he couldn’t understand their feelings. If a CEO who had never visited till now suddenly appeared in the cafeteria, it would probably turn out like this. Suzuki Satoru would likely do the same in this situation. Perhaps it would have been different if this company was a lot smaller, the kind where the distance between the boss and the employees was much</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">closer.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That’s probably impossible in this case though…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It would be extremely difficult to suddenly change his image as the admirable dictator Ainz-sama into one of an Ainz-san that was loved by everyone.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Maybe if everyone found out he was an idiot, such a change could be possible, but he would not be able to bear it if he ended up getting scorned instead (which was unlikely).</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Well then, let’s enter.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Turning back to the party, he tried to observe the elves’ reactions discreetly. He didn’t even need to observe them much, they were clearly shriveling up.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Understandable. They should have noticed the harmonious mood in the cafeteria before Ainz’s arrival. This was what he meant by “the sudden heteromorph in Alfheim”.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t think of a way to solve this.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps they will get used to this over time, Ainz walked into the cafeteria with such optimistic thoughts.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t want to make the maids even more tense, so he approached a random table far from them and pointed at the seat opposite his.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“You can sit there.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elves started looking at each other with troubled expressions. It looked like they were trying to decide who was going to be stuck with the onus of sitting in front of Ainz. He was probably right in thinking that.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“…I see. Maybe Elven customs are different from ours, so let’s just keep this informal and not worry about those things.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He tried to give them a way out by acting like he interpreted their hesitation differently. It would not be good if they hesitated too much, he was also a bit afraid of the twins’ reaction if they hesitated too much.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“You there. Sit opposite of me.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz pointed at the elf standing at the back. If he remembered correctly, she never stood in the middle of the elves, so he thought it was fair that she should be the one who was going to be stuck with him.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Honestly speaking, he did not want to be treated like some kind of baggage. That said, as someone who understood their feelings all too well, he decided to be practical.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It was quick after that.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The seats beside the specified elf’s were immediately taken. Aura and Mare sat beside Ainz.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He wanted to say many things about the fact that Lumière was standing behind him, but decided to bottle it up in the end.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Now then— Sorry, but this is my first time using the cafeteria, so explain to me a bit about how it works at this hour.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Ainz asked Lumière because as a regular maid she should have used the cafeteria just like how her fellow maids were doing now.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“First things first—yes. I want to order drinks, so is there something like a menu?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“There are free drinks and a buffet system at this time. We are supposed to get the drinks and a simple salad from over there by ourselves.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Looking at where Lumière was pointing at, he could see a row of pitchers that seem to hold the drinks. Beside them were multiple chafing dishes.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“And you can also select one item from the lunch menu here.” “I see…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“As the chef is in the kitchen, I believe he will prepare any dish Ainz-sama wishes.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Is that so? But there’s no need. If there’s a fixed lunch menu, let’s just select something from there.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Lumière handed over a sheet of paper.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">A menu was printed on it, in Japanese. The elves probably wouldn’t be able to read this. Also—</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“…ever heard of Katsudon?” Elves shook their heads to say no.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“…Aura, Mare, what do these elves usually eat?” “Just the normal food?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Y-yes. M-most of the time, it’s the s-same as ours.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In that case, did the twins’ never have katsudon? No, they were usually getting their meals served by the delivery service, and they should also be able to make it by themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Have you never eaten katsudon?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“No, we have had it before. It’s probably just that they don’t know its name.” “Ah, so it’s something like that…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The menu did not have any holograms attached to it, so it stood to reason that they couldn’t match the appearance with the name.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz wanted to ask for “the chef’s recommendation,” but fearing the situation in which he would be told that everything was recommended, he decided against</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">it. “Here…that reminds me. Do you normally eat meat?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">After he saw the elves nod, Ainz selected an item from the menu. “Hamburg steak meals for everyone here.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“As for the sauces you can select among the demi-glace, Japanese-style sauce, or cream-mustard sauce. You can also select rice or bread to go along with it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“…how about bread and demi-glace?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He could understand the demi-glace and the Japanese-style sauces, but he wondered what the cream-mustard would taste like.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The fact that he couldn’t taste them himself due to his body was regrettable. “Okay!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Y-yes. It’s ok for m-me too.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Following the twins’ energetic voices, the elves also nodded quickly in tow. It looked like there were no objections.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Then, that will be my order.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Fuu, Ainz breathed out. It didn’t look like Lumière was going to head to the kitchen to relay the order, Ainz wondered why. Perhaps someone who was working here would come over to receive their order.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“What about the drinks, Ainz-sama?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“—aah. I forgot about that. Everyone can go and get what they like. That should be fine, right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Yes. Then I will bring over Ainz-sama’s drink myself. What shall it be?” “Something suitable—ah, no, get me a hot coffee.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Understood.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The others went to the table with the drinks with Aura at their lead.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Elsewhere, the kitchen suddenly became noisy after Lumière went over there and said something.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">As he continued to look, someone came out from the kitchen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">A giant cleaver hung by his waist. A wok on his back. A slovenly, naked torso with “Fresh Meat!!” tattooed on it. And finally, a gold chain around his neck.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Though his face may look like an orc’s, he was an ork, a similar species that was much closer to wild beasts.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">(T/N: “ork” last appeared in the EESS, where the kanji read “wild ork” but it’s just katakana here)</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">There was a pure white toque on his head and a pure white apron around his waist.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">This man was the Area Guardian of the cafeteria and the head chef himself.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Shihoutu Tokitu.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Shihoutu Tokitu quickly ran over to Ainz and kneeled. <i>Won’t the chef’s clothes get dirty? </i>is what Ainz thought upon seeing that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Ainz-sama! We welcome you!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“It’s been a long time, Shihoutu Tokitu. I am glad to see that you are the same as ever.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“HAH!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Though Ainz said that he looked the same, the last time he met him was just after they were teleported here, back when he visited all the NPCs. Since it had been so long, he was not exactly confident in noticing changes if there were any.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“No, maybe you are slightly thinner now?” “If Ainz-sama thinks so, then it is so!”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">That’s not what I meant! <span class="p">Ainz swallowed his words.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I noticed the absence of Ainz-sama’s order among the ones the maid relayed…I get it now!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A masculine smile (though he couldn’t be sure as he did not understand orc expressions) welled up on Shihoutu Tokitu’s face. <i>No, you don’t get it at all, </i>Ainz thought. Was he ever actually understood even once in such situations? Regrettably, he didn’t think so.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I am to prepare food suitable for a Supreme Being, for the absolute ruler of Nazarick, Ainz-sama!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">While Ainz was muttering “there he goes!” in his mind, Shihoutu Tokitu stood up with vigor and shouted in the kitchen’s direction.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“From now on it’s do or die! A dish suitable for Ainz-sama! A food festival that won’t stop for at least a week, begins!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Ooooo,” the sounds of admiration rose from the maids who were listening. “Oi, wait.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“HAH!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Shihoutu Tokitu returned back to Ainz and kneeled again.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was hard to say this to someone shouting “I am going to do it! I am going to do it!” with all their might. Ainz generally thought that he should go along with what NPCs wanted, but this was a bit too much for him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…It looks like you are misunderstanding something. Just to be sure, you do know that I can’t eat food as an undead, right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“HAH! So we are to make something that can be enjoyed by sight and smell!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That is what Ainz-sama has in mind! Understood!”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Ainz replied to Shihoutu Tokitu while he was trying to stand back up, “oi, wait” “HAH!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Don’t be hasty. I am trying to say that I can’t eat, so don’t waste any ingredients.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“What are you saying Ainz-sama! Ingredients used for Ainz-sama cannot be considered wasted! Yes!” Shihoutu Tokitu said as he stood up and turned towards the cafeteria. That brought about a round of applause. Not just the maids but even Aura and Mare joined in on it. The elves quickly followed the others in panic.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">You don’t have to follow along, you know… <span class="p">Ainz grumbled internally. “Well, I will start at once!”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Oi, wait.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“HAH!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz spoke honestly to the kneeling Shihoutu Tokitu, “I am going to be frank. I did not come here to eat. I came here to have an enjoyable—yes, an enjoyable conversation. I understand your expression of welcome to a suffocating extent, but I do not care for it that much. Can I get you to understand that I just want to have a calm conversation?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz could understand why Shihoutu Tokitu was filled with such fanatical motivation. Someone like the ruler of Nazarick, who couldn’t possibly visit such a place, came today. He probably just wanted to give the best welcome possible, but that’s not what Ainz was here for.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“HAH! Then let me reserve the whole place!” “Oi, wait.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“HAH!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Don’t make a mountain out of a molehill. I will repeat myself, I only came here to have a little chat. There’s no need to take things so far, understood?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz took a quick glance at the others—especially the elves—and found that they were just staring at him with serious expressions.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The maids were already half away from their seats, prepared to leave at any time. The twins acted like this was just normal, while the elves seemed like they were afraid that the situation was going to get out of hand. Even though he selected this place specifically because he didn’t want the elves to feel like that— [board’s bookmark for proofing]</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—I am not being modest, that’s really the reason why I came here. All of you may continue as usual. Please treat me like you would any other guest.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“HAH! But! To treat a Supreme Being such as Ainz-sama in the same way as others!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Ainz couldn’t be faulted for using underhanded means if it came to this. He cleared his throat and shifted his tone to sound more serious.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“—Shihoutu Tokitu” “HAH!”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I am saying that I want to see what this place usually looks like. If you have been diligent with your duties, you wouldn’t have to do anything special now, correct? Or, are you trying to show me something different from usual because you have something to hide?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Shihoutu Tokitu gulped and made an expression that was filled with resolve (or that’s what it looked like to Ainz).</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“A word please, Ainz-sama! This Shihoutu Tokitu, who had been entrusted with this place by the Supreme Being Amanomahitotsu, never did a single thing that would cause him shame!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Of course.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Shihoutu Tokitu looked puzzled at Ainz’s instant reply.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Even though I have only interacted with you for a short while, I can see that you are devoted to your work and are truly loyal to the ones you call Supreme Beings. My words just now were quite thoughtless. I take them back and offer my apologies.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz bowed his head.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Ooo! Ainz-sama! Please don’t do that! A Supreme Being such as you bowing to me! Please lift your noble face!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz slowly raised his head and looked straight at Shihoutu Tokitu. “Shihoutu Tokitu. I am glad that you accepted my apology. But I want you to</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">know and understand. I just want to have a look at how you and this place are normally whilst holding a relaxed conversation. Just treat me like a normal guest.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Shihoutu Tokitu grumbled a bit, but he seemingly came to a compromise internally and nodded.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Understood.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Is that so, that’s great. A day may come when we will invite VIPs—important people from other places—to Nazarick. You may display your full talent at that time, I will be relying on you then.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“HAH! —b-but something like bowing to the likes of me…”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“My regret at deriding you was a large part of the reason why I did that, but you may also consider it as my apology to the Amanoma-san who trusted in you and entrusted you with this place.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Shihoutu Tokitu made a bitter smile, an expression of defeat at the face of such an explanation. But, he immediately returned to his work face. Of course, all of the above was just what it looked like from Ainz’s point of view.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—In that case, Ainz-sama, I will take my leave to work on the order.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz watched Shihoutu Tokitu’s back as he left and raised his voice a bit so that it would reach everyone in the cafeteria.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Sorry for the disturbance everyone. Well then, please continue dining without worry.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura and the others returned to the table, as if they were replacing Shihoutu Tokitu. At a few of the tables here and there, the maids started eating again. It felt like the atmosphere was less tense now. It looked like the incident with Shihoutu Tokitu helped relieve some of the tension.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura and the others each held their preferred drinks while Lumière placed Ainz’s coffee in front of him.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He could smell the coffee’s rich fragrance, a mysterious smell with hints of some kind of berry in it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">YGGDRASIL never had any cross promotions with brands but it had a lot of content in it including foodstuffs. Normal games would probably stop at a simple [Coffee-bean] but YGGDRASIL had multiple varieties of them. Each of them was also graded differently with the ones at the highest grade bringing out the best effects from the food.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the beans in Nazarick’s inventory were of a good grade and this coffee should certainly be tasty.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">This is probably what quality coffee smells like. Would it also taste like berries?</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">While feeling sad that his body was unable to taste it, Ainz waited until everyone took their seats to speak.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Well, let’s talk while enjoying our drinks.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Two of the elves had melon soda while the other one had green tea with ice in it. Following Ainz’s words, they took a sip. The melon soda group blinked in surprise, pressing their hands to their mouths. Their reaction was certainly not a bad one.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Wow, so tasty.” “Sweet.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The two who whispered those words quickly emptied their glasses. Ainz was counting on this to happen. He spoke gently to them, “—How about a refill?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Ah, yes, please let us do so.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The two elves immediately nodded and headed over to the drinks section.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">There was a spring in their steps. “It’s good that they liked it.” “Ah, yes.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz spoke to the remaining elf. She was probably also interested in their drinks, as she quickly finished her tea and stood up. By the way, both of the twins went with cola and from their expressions, it looked like it was nothing special for them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Many unexpected things had happened on the way, but it looked like the elves had mostly calmed down. They no longer seemed like they would doubt everything he said just because he was an undead.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">As expected, sweet things are effective. There are no women who would hate sweet things. A woman who can resist sweet things simply does not exist…So Mocchimochi- san’s was correct all along. I thought it was just an excuse for her reckless eating habits… <span class="p">The other two female members of Ainz Ooal Gown had tilted their heads at that statement—although slimes didn’t have necks—but it was not like they denied it either. With the way the elves acted just now, that counted as two things that could probably serve as proof she was not exactly wrong. Well, he still had</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">his suspicions.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Now, at last. I have gone through a lot of simulations in my mind, but I wonder if I can get a discussion about the Elven country going smoothly…</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">He remembered what they heard from the elves when they met the first time. There was no name for the country of elves that was said to be in the great forest of the south. Albedo surmised that it was because they never had the need to open diplomatic relations with other races, the other nations were far away from it in the first place. As they had no need to identify their land as something</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">separate from the rest, just calling it a country was enough for them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">However, it seemed like after being ruled for so long by a king, it was being called a kingdom. This king was supposedly super strong. What his strengths and classes were was something they did not manage to find out. At that point, the elves looked at the twins, probably wondering why they did not know about this. This country of elves was embroiled in hostilities with the Theocracy at the present moment and these elves were sold as slaves after they were captured by</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">the Theocracy. What the war was for and when did it start were questions to which these elves had no answers for.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was probably because this country of elves did not have a standardized education system. These elves also did not have any interest in learning about such matters. Although after hearing what they said, it seemed like they were at least instructed on more important skills and knowledge (mostly consisting of stuff about monsters). Maybe they felt that history and similar subjects were not useful enough to be taught.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">When asked about the dark elves in their country, they replied that although they had never seen them, they do exist. In fact, Aura and Mare were the first dark elves they had ever met. Dark elves are likely a minority in the Elven country, but it didn’t seem like they were persecuted according to these elves. That said, considering the lack of knowledge these elves demonstrated, it was entirely possible that they just didn’t know about it. And—that was all of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">That was all the information Ainz managed to get out of them at that time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had to be satisfied with such meager information just so that they wouldn’t get suspicious. But he had a great excuse for being proactive in asking them now. Patience is a virtue, as the saying goes.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Well, I should make a decision first. Should I make the topic about wanting to open diplomatic relations between our nations? Or how about saying that I want to go to a dark elf village to find friends for Aura and Mare?</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They would be on guard if the conversation was about something on national- level relations. It was easier to make them talk if it was a reason that a normal person could sympathize with. Moreover, Ainz need not lie as he was really aiming for the second reason, so it would be easier for him. Ainz was a person who could lie as much as he wanted to but that didn’t mean he liked to do so. It was just that he wouldn’t hesitate to lie if there was some benefit to be had.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was also better not to lie in case they somehow managed to figure out the truth later.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">That should be the easier way…but I can’t imagine how it would turn out if I bring reason up in front of Aura and Mare</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He was afraid they would feel duty-bound to make friends. In his honest opinion, friendship was something that was formed gradually with people with similar hobbies. He wouldn’t call it friendship when someone was ordered to do it. Ainz remembered his friends from YGGDRASIL—his former guildmates. Those comrades he made from chance meetings and through fate’s</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">machinations.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was just that he didn’t know if children needed to make friends or not. Ainz…Suzuki Satoru didn’t have any during his childhood and that didn’t cause any problems for him in his opinion.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Being that kind of person, the fact that Ainz was even thinking about things like making friends was because Yamaiko used to say something to that effect long ago. At the same time, he also remembered Ulbert responding with, “that’s the pipe dream of people who live in a different world than us”, sarcastically laughing at her words.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz didn’t know who was in the right here. In any case, there was nothing to lose by having friends.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In that case, how about I stop thinking about it in terms of them making friends and tell them it’s about making dark elf acquaintances? Whether they become friends or not will be up to them. Of course, it’s all the better if they manage to make some</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">With that said, if there was an extreme difference in power and standing between two parties, wouldn’t it be a hindrance to the development of friendships? Everyone was equal in YGGDRASIL.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—Ainz frowned a bit as some of his friends came to mind suddenly, but he immediately shook his head, clearing away those memories.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They probably wouldn’t have become friends if they had met in the real world with its inequalities. With that thought in mind, the first step should be to approach the dark elves in the Elven country on equal terms as much as possible. Dark elves from the Sorcerer Kingdom’s top echelon and dark elves that are a minority in the Elven country wouldn’t make for a good match at all.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Apart from trying to conceal our status as much as possible…umm. Do all fathers around the world have to think about these things this much? I wonder how Touch-me san did it, maybe I should have asked him for more details.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">While Ainz was worrying about the soon-to-be-had conversation, the elves returned back to their seats. All of them went with cola.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Oh no, I didn’t get my thoughts straight yet… I should not ad-lib everything.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But, there was no time left. As long as the twins were here, he could only say that this was about opening diplomatic relations. If things wouldn’t go smoothly, he could just bring up the idea about making friends as a side topic. Or, maybe he could spin it as his wish to deepen relationships with the dark elves as a part of micro-level diplomacy.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Well then—let’s proceed to the main topic.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The elves who were guzzling their drinks like it was the last drink of their life, suddenly stopped.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“We have established a nation named the Sorcerer Kingdom at present. The plan is to have various races live in coexistence. Some humans, dwarves, goblins, orcs, and lizardmen have already become citizens of our nation. Leaving aside whether or not the Elves would approve of this, I want to initiate diplomatic relations with the Elven nation as well as trade relations. As such, I wish to visit your nation. Won’t you cooperate with us?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even though it was just an excuse right now, it was not bad to have diplomatic and trade relations with the Elven country. However, there was a critical problem.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz cannot be the emissary for this matter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Conferring with the foreign affairs of another country and making a treaty to open diplomatic relations was something out of Ainz’s capabilities. Although it went smoothly with the dwarves, he doubted that he would succeed in the same way again. Rather, it was more likely to end up the opposite of what he intended. Therefore, he wanted to send wise people in his stead if they were to engage in diplomacy. Albedo was the best choice for this, but he didn’t want to assign her any additional work as she would be busy for a while managing the occupied</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">territories of the Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She would probably say “it’s fine” if he ordered her, and she would probably be right. But, that would mean she would have to overstretch herself to make it work, so Ainz needed to keep his subordinates’ mental health in mind to not overwork them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz would have been extremely happy if they just made this conversation just about making personal acquaintances with the Dark Elves instead of making it about something so important.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Eh, Ah, Ainz Ooal Gown-sama? What exactly does this cooperation entail?” Ainz shrugged slightly at her cautious response.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">“First, I want to hear some details from you. Also, just ‘Ainz’ is fine, you know?” “We will be at your service if it’s something we know-” the elf replied with a determined look, “b-but please forgive us for not being able to address you so…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura, Mare, and the maids around them who were secretly eavesdropping had perplexed expressions.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If elves called him Ainz, then they would be told that they were being “over- familiar” and should “understand their position.” But, if they did not, they would</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">be told, “how dare they refuse Ainz-sama’s order.” They were probably feeling conflicted because they knew that they would react in that exact way.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t intend to scold the maids listening in. It’s not like they were doing it out of malice or simple curiosity. He felt they would go “me, me” to be on call if he needed them during this conversation.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Is that so, that’s regrettable. So, returning to the topic at hand… How is the Elven country? How do you deal with monsters seeing that you live in the forests?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The elves had confused expressions, as if they were just asked a weird question. “While we live in the forest, our homes are on the top of trees, because it’s</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">dangerous on the ground.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“We make our homes by transforming trees using druid magic.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“The trees suitable for such magic are also grown by magic. We call them Elf Trees.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">From what they said, it seemed like the Elves could change the shape of trees using druid magic. Like creating cavities inside the trees or shaping bridges between trees. An Elf village was just a place where tens of those structures were bunched up together.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This method of making things out of Elf Trees seemed to be at the core of Elven culture. Not just homes or furniture, they could also create weapons and armor out of it. It was possible to make the arrows they used for hunting to be as hard as iron.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz wanted them to demonstrate this magic as it did not exist in YGGDRASIL. They were surprised at that request because from their point of view, the tree the twins lived in was an example right there. It looked like they thought it was a mutated Elf Tree (because it looked different) that could only be transformed by those two.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Furthermore, as that magic can only be used on Elf Trees, it didn’t work with other trees. Because the Elves lived in such conditions, monsters that were good at climbing trees like snakes or spiders were their natural enemies. Although they had things like a nightwatch, those monsters also tended to be good at concealment; there were still victims every now and then. On the other hand, they did not get attacked as much by monsters that couldn’t climb because it was easier to fight them off.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It seemed like the Elven capital (the only place the Elves could call a city as they were not a populous race) was the only settlement that was constructed in</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">a place without the forest’s cover, on the shore of a crescent-shaped lake. The “seemed like” was added because these elves never visited the capital and only heard about it from others.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They could establish that city on a plain because there was a giant monster in the lake that captured and ate any large monsters that came nearby.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">I see… <span class="p">Ainz thought.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As druid magic could also provide water, living on the trees was advantageous for them. As for flying monsters, the canopy of the Elf Trees could act as a shield while also hiding them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Living in such circumstances, it was natural that most of the Elves gain abilities as rangers or druids. In other words, they could not survive without developing such abilities.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">I don’t know how class selection works in this world, but seems like without jobs like farmers among them, the Elves are more likely to be better fighters than humans</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He continued, asking them about the lifespans and population of the Elves.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They were evidently not that concerned about how long they lived, seeing as they did not know their own lifespans. It seemed like the oldest person there was thought to be over 300 years old. By the way, these elves didn’t even know their own age. It was likely that they did not have the concept of a birthday.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps it was due to their long lives, they did not give birth frequently like humans and thus their populations were much smaller. However, upon learning more, Ainz thought that the number of children they had was not small at all.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In YGGDRASIL’s setting, an elf’s lifespan was a thousand years…they age up quickly in the first 10 years and then in the last 10 years, I think? I don’t remember the exact details, but I think it’s something like that. Or am I wrong? Also, if they supposedly gave birth once every decade… if we consider 200 years old as the start of adulthood and 400 years old to be when infertility sets in…20 children? I want to learn more details about this in the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Then—If I were to return you to your former village, where would I go?” Elves started looking at each other.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I see, of course they will not talk about it. It’s important information after all.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">After a while, one of the elves inquired hesitantly.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“E-excuse me… But are we going to be sent back to our homes?” “…mm?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Noticing their strange choice of words, Ainz realized his mistake. “…That’s right. I forgot that your village was attacked by the Theocracy.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">These elves were not soldiers, just people who were living in the village that were captured during the Theocracy’s attack on it. From their point of view, it was painful to return back to that place. Plus, their safety could not be guaranteed.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Let’s do this. Instead of returning you to your village, we’ll take you to a safe place. Do you have any such place in mind? A village with your relatives or if there aren’t any, how about the capital?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“The capital…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Please forgive us. We don’t know any other place except the surroundings of our village…”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I wonder which place can be considered a safe place…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">These elves were unfamiliar with information outside of their village, but that wasn’t something limited to these girls. It’s the same for the villagers from the Kingdom or the Empire.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">People in this world mostly live out their entire lives at their place of birth, especially for those without education. Though they would barely know about their neighboring cities, the other cities in their country might as well be foreign lands to them.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">While Ainz was pondering over this, the elves spoke again. “Excuse us…but are we really going to be sent back outside?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“That’s what I planned to do. If we are to engage in diplomacy with the Elven country, keeping you here would make the other side dissatisfied. You understand, don’t you? I kept you here until now as an emergency measure, but it will be hard to continue doing so. However, I am not cruel enough to release you in a land under the control of the Slaine Theocracy. That’s why I asked you for a safe location—”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Although Ainz did not intend to be the emissary, returning these three back safely would probably help with future diplomacy.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Seeing that the elves wanted to say something, Ainz asked them, “what’s the matter?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Is it possible to let us continue staying here?” “…hmmmm.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz moved his gaze to the drinks in front of the elves. There was no way that was the reason right?</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…why? …I can understand if you don’t want to tell me, but please do if possible.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“About that—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">The elf representing them took a quick look at the twins.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“…Aura, Mare. It looks like your drinks are nearly finished. Why don’t you go and get some more?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Eh!?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“Okay! Understood Ainz-sama—Let’s go Mare.” Splendid.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ainz admired Aura’s quick wit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If he was in Aura’s place, he wouldn’t have understood so quickly that he was being told indirectly to get away for a while. Or perhaps his “working adult senses” would have instantly understood it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One could stand to reason that Aura was better than Albedo or Demiurge at reading the mood. Ainz could imagine Demiurge with a grin saying, “so that’s what it is, Ainz-sama”.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Those two would completely misunderstand my intentions…to the point where I sometimes doubt if they are doing it intentionally. Or are they really doing it intentionally?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Eh, eh?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Aura dragged away the still puzzled Mare by his arms. Ainz spoke after they were distant enough, “can you say it now?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Y-yes.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf replied, after confirming that the twins are far enough from them with a quick glance. A Dark Elf’s sense of hearing was better than a human’s and rangers like Aura were even better at it. The elf before him was probably whispering with that in mind, but it was highly likely that Aura could still hear them.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“We are already used to our life here, and we cannot return to that life again… This place…Aura-sama and Mare-sama’s house is the best.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Eh?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz initially lowered his volume to match the elf’s, but he let out his usual voice at the sudden surprise.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He thought that they were joking for a moment, but after he saw the other two nodding seriously he understood that was their true sentiment.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">First, it seemed like the food quality in Nazarick was on a different level. Elves normally ate fruits, meats, and vegetables by either roasting or boiling them. The amount of passion Nazarick puts into its food was completely different.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elves said with certainty that they were not confident they could ever adjust to their former lives after getting used to the food here. By the way, pizza seemed to be their favorite.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">I see… Culinary diplomacy does not seem like such a bad idea. Being able to access such fine cuisine should be a point of appeal. …are they dwarves or what!</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The elves also had other reasons.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The level of safety here was also completely different. Even if they lived in a moderately safe place like a village created by druid magic, it was impossible for a year to pass without any casualties occurring due to monsters. In contrast, one could sleep peacefully in Nazarick even without having someone to guard the night.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They had a lot to say, but if it was something like this, there was no need to get the twins away from here. As Ainz wondered if there were more reasons, she added, “and being able to serve those two is a joy.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“…aah,” Ainz nodded empathetically.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Those two were of a similar race to the elves and were cute children to boot. They probably had doubts about serving children, but Aura’s and Mare’s personalities had likely won them over.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even Ainz would select the twins if he was asked which of the Floor Guardians he would like to serve. No, if someone did ask him, he would probably say something like, “I can’t choose because everyone is wonderful”. But if he was being honest, it would be those two. Next in line might be Cocytus. He really didn’t want to serve the others.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Still, he thought this was something that could be said in the twins’ presence. Although he thought that they had something else to say, it seemed like this was the end of their talk.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Honestly, I don’t understand at all. Wasn’t it fine for the twins to hear this? Was there something in the previous conversation that would get them reprimanded by the twins? …well, whatever</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Very well. Then I want you to continue working in Nazarick as you have done until now.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">There was no reason to refuse their wish.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elves looked happy upon hearing Ainz’s response. It didn’t seem like they were putting on an act to flatter Ainz. “Although, if we are talking about employing you formally, we will need to discuss salary and welfare first. I will order someone to look into it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It appeared that the elves did not understand what Ainz was talking about, but this was an important issue to him.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">How these elves were to be treated would become an important factor when they establish friendly relations with the Dark Elves in the Elven country. They could say that after freeing the elves from slavery and looking after the elves, the elves were just paying back what they had received. But, there was a limit to such excuses. Their present situation of uncompensated labor mirrored the practices of a black company. He did not want the Dark Elves that might visit here in the future to get such an impression.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In that case, he just had to use these three to set Nazarick’s precedent as a white company.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz took a quick glance at the maids around them.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">They were cupping their hands behind their ears as if to hear them better while trying to make it look like they were resting their chins in their palms.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">They were not at all concerned about their appearances.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t feel like reproaching them since he thought that it was just a display of their loyalty, but he at least wanted them to hide it a little better.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">I should make a contract with these elves as soon as possible. Also, should I try extending the white company treatment from these elves to the regular maids?</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He could try, but he was afraid that the maids who just wanted to work more would direct their ire at the elves who were the cause for the increase in their leisure time. Of course, he didn’t think they would go as far as killing the elves, but he needed to be careful if he decided to extend the treatment to the maids.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Leaving that aside, I want to borrow your help in our excursion to the Elven country. I want you to act as guides, if possible. Of course, Aura and Mare will also come with us. It’s just that we’re not familiar with Elven etiquette so it would help if you were to act as our intermediaries.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The elves looked at each other and shook their heads.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Forgive us, but we don’t have confidence in acting as guides. As for being intermediaries…although we have traveled around our village, we are also not sure about things like etiquette…”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“Is that so…” “Sorry!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Ah, you don’t need to bow.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">It would be bothersome to visit an unknown place without a guide, but it was not like he was sure these elves could be of use. If he was going into the unknown</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">anyway, it would be better to not force them to come along. They might even end up becoming a burden.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz turned around and beckoned Lumière over. After she brought her face closer to him, Ainz whispered “just a bit more” and lifted his cup. Of course, the contents of the cup were not touched at all. Just to be sure, he gestured in the twins’ direction with his eyes.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He thought he was being a bit obtuse but it seemed like she quickly understood and left with a simple “excuse me”.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“And—what is the general opinion on Dark Elves among you Elves?” “They are splendid beings.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ainz wrinkled his brows at the instant, somewhat suspicious response.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">He would be happy if that was how dark elves were thought of but their answer felt off.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Ainz could immediately think of the reason why. It was about Aura and Mare. “—No, that’s not it. I am asking about the relations between the Dark Elf race</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">and your race of the Elves.” “They are splendid beings.” “That’s not…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He probably couldn’t do anything about this kind of kowtowing. After being treated as subordinates of the twins’ for so long, they couldn’t possibly say something like, “Dark Elves are an inferior race after all.” Rather, it would be scarier if they were the kind of people who could say something like that.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“As I have mentioned before, I want to open diplomatic relations with the Elf country. I also want to entrust this to the twins. That’s why I want to know how Elves as a whole look at Dark Elves. I don’t want them to be mistreated if Elven society holds negative opinions of Dark Elves. So what do you think? I need an honest answer.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The elves looked at each other.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Honestly, as our village did not have any dark elves, we’ve only met them here for the first time. That’s why we didn’t have any opinions about them. The most we know was that they migrated from the north to the great forest.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“We’ve heard of their dark skins from hearsay and were surprised to see that was true.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I don’t remember the villagers saying anything bad about the Dark Elves, but I would ask you to keep in mind that this is only about our village.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It looked like they were no longer trying to flatter him or tell any lies. So the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">younger (maybe calling them young was stretching it a bit) Elves didn’t have any bad opinions against Dark Elves.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even though they were a minority, it looked like they weren’t being persecuted. Perhaps it was because the Elves didn’t have the leeway for such things when they were being threatened by an external force–the Theocracy. Or perhaps the forest was just that much of a difficult place to live in.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“…by the way what about the undead?” “Enemies that sully the forest.” “Disgusting beings.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“We rarely encounter any though.” “Ah, yes.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Immediate answers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">While Ainz wondered why they weren’t taking into consideration the feelings of the twins’ master, he couldn’t say that out loud.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He certainly asked them to speak honestly just now, but this was too honest. These girls were the type who would get fired because they truly believed in the CEO’s words when they were told to be informal.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Still, with that established, he was now certain that he could not be the emissary. Maybe this was for the best. He could use this as an excuse to not be the emissary. It was certainly not because Ainz wasn’t talented enough.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Or should he take the steps in proper order—dispatch diplomats, start diplomatic relations, and then head over to the Elven country.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But we don’t have such diplomats. …The fact that we can’t trust the human officials in charge of internal affairs is a weak point… Or maybe there are some and I just don’t know about it. In that case, how about asking Albedo to dispatch adventurers? No…that system isn’t stable enough yet to send them out to represent the nation…or maybe I am wrong. After all, it’s me we’re talking about.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">If he informed Albedo about this, she would probably say that the adventurers would work just fine. But—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—the critical issue here is the lack of time.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Due to the hostilities with the Theocracy, the Elven country was pretty much pushed into a corner. This had been the case since before these elves were captured. If things went badly, it was entirely possible that the Elven country would be destroyed soon.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The collapse of the Elven country was not a setback for Ainz, because they would be far more effective in establishing diplomatic relations if the Sorcerer</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Kingdom could extend their help in that scenario. So, would it be better if they just waited for the collapse? That was not the case.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">They didn’t have the luxury of watching the situation from the sidelines, especially because he highly valued the rarity of the Dark Elf lives.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Maybe I should just send the two of them ahead—no, I can’t do that. I don’t feel comfortable sending them alone into an unknown place. Although I understand that they are level 100 NPCs and are not children…we should just ignore the stuff on international relations and concentrate on getting them friends. I should also go with them just as I have planned</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had no plans to join in the war with the Theocracy and save the Elven country at this point in time. Ainz didn’t want to turn the Theocracy into the Sorcerer Kingdom’s enemy due to his independent action.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wanted to know Albedo and Demiurge’s thoughts on this matter, but he feared that they might find out his skull was empty if he did that. If Ainz couldn’t manage the conversation, his idiotic utterances might end up being taken seriously and cause damage to Nazarick in the future.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It’s not a bad idea to tell them to evacuate just the dark elves after visiting the Elven country. In that case…is there a need to take someone along other than the twins?</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It was better to take stealthy guards like Hanzos along instead of leading something like an army in case he did decide to take someone along.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Like that time in the Dwarf Kingdom. “I see…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz stared at the three elves. They would be in that lizardman’s position this time.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I-is something the matter?” “Nothing, I am just talking to myself.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He could take one among the three with him, leaving the other two here. As long as he held them hostage, the lone elf probably wouldn’t do anything that would be negative to Ainz.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Not bad at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Even if they understood that they were being held hostage, he could insist that was not the case.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz looked over to the twins. They immediately understood his intentions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Aura, Mare, and Lumière returned to the table.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“By the way, what kind of gifts would make Elves happy? Things like gold and gemstones?”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“We don’t use metal currency so I don’t think gold would work…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I think our village would be most happy about the food and maybe rare herbs. Minor scrapes and such can be healed by magic but poison and disease need a talented druid to cure them. So portable herbs are highly valued.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Not clothes, since we also make them from Elf Trees”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Homes, arrows…and even clothes. Looks like Elven druid magic is very convenient. You can’t do that, right Mare? ”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Eh? Ah, y-yes. I can’t use such magic.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps this peculiar brand of druid magic itself was a mark of Elven progress. He wanted those techniques if possible, but Nazarick’s residents probably wouldn’t be able to use them. This reaffirms the fact that making the residents of this world prostrate before Nazarick and bringing them under its reign would be the main factor that could tip the scales of victory in a hypothetical guild war.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">But—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">I should assume there were guilds—those who were teleported in the past—who already did this. I should tell this to Albedo and have her look into rethinking our national strategy on war.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It stood to reason that if someone like Ainz could think of this, other Players could as well. Only idiots would think of themselves as someone special.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Maybe it will be a good idea to transport large amounts of food through [Gate] upon reaching the Elven villages to make them more friendly to the Sorcerer Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He remembered it being effective in the Dwarf Kingdom. Things would go smoothly if he could just remember his experiences in the Dwarf Kingdom and build on them.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">I also felt like wanting to run away then too, didn’t I…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…the best way to do this is to first find the crescent lake, visit the royal capital that was said to be on its shore to collect information, and then head to Dark Elves’ village.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“We are going to a Dark Elf village?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura looked like she wanted to say something, but she probably couldn’t ask in detail in front of the three elves.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If possible, Ainz didn’t want to tell them they were visiting the Dark Elves’ village to find them friends. He didn’t want them to make friends just because he ordered them to.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“That’s right. That’s what I intend to do. I am going to need your help there.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He deliberately ignored Aura’s behavior, but he still got a pair of energetic affirmations in return.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">What should I do next…persuade the others? I can’t make the same excuse I used for the dwarven expedition…</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wasn’t confident about the next step, but he had to succeed here because he also wanted to use this as the groundwork to bring the concept of paid vacations to Nazarick.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">At that point—maybe they were waiting for the conversation to die down— the dishes were brought over.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Well, enjoy yourselves.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">With Ainz encouraging them, the elves took to the food with relish.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark12">3</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">What would a person do when faced with a challenge?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There were many methods suitable for overcoming one and this time Ainz chose to use the advantage of numbers and location.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">With Aura and Mare flanking him, Ainz sat down on the throne in the audience hall prepared by the guardians, finally holding the original Staff of Ainz Ooal Gown after a long time.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The ultimate form of the absolute ruler of Nazarick and the guild leader Ainz Ooal Gown, so to speak.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Still, his victory against the opponent that would be appearing soon was not a certain thing. The opponent was the true last boss. A boss more fearsome than something like the Devourer of the Nine Worlds, Ainz thought as he gulped with his non-existent throat.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had already gone through the simulations multiple times, but Ainz was just an ordinary person. He likely doesn’t even reach the foot of the mountain that was his opponent’s intellect.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">So—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">There’s nothing else to do…except leaving it all to luck!!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He was placing his hopes on his ad-lib skills. He was sure his future self would pull through.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Lumière, who had been waiting before the entrance, announced the opponent’s arrival.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“—very well. Let them enter” “Understood, Ainz-sama.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Everyone should have understood who the opponent was by now.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It was none other than the last boss AKA Guardian Overseer, Albedo.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The moment she noticed Ainz, Albedo switched from her usual smiling face to a serious expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Please forgive me for making you wait.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Seeing Albedo bowing deeply near the entrance, Ainz ordered her to lift her head up.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Don’t worry about it, Albedo. I was already informed that you would be late.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">So you can even say that you are on time.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">When contacted through [Message] beforehand, Albedo informed him that because she was doing something in the Frozen Prison, her appearance might not be suitable for an audience. So, she requested some time to make herself presentable.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">With no reason to refuse her request, Ainz designated this time (30 minutes more than what Albedo requested) to meet him here. The fact that Albedo still arrived ten minutes before the designated time was likely due to her personality. Or maybe it was just an iron-clad rule for working adults to always arrive before time.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Albedo lifted her head, walked before the throne, and kneeled. Ainz informed her immediately.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Albedo. I am taking a paid vacation starting right this moment”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He could make any number of excuses, but every time he did that, the conversation tended to go in weird directions. So he felt it was better to directly state his goal here. Demiurge was absent this time, so it is unlikely to lead to some strange development.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Albedo scrunched up her brows slightly while lifting her head up to look at Ainz. She then cast her gaze to the left and right of him, probably checking Aura and Mare’s reactions to those words.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz continued to observe Albedo, worried about her reaction. She replied with a serious expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Including Nazarick, everything in the Sorcerer Kingdom belongs to Ainz- sama.”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">—what?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He couldn’t understand what she was saying at all. No, not one bit.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">How could one arrive at such a response?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">What leaps of logic, what train of thought would lead one to such a conclusion? How should Ainz respond?</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He could immediately think of two replies.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“What the hell are you saying?” <span class="p">was one, the other was </span>“Yes, just as you have surmised.” <span class="p">Of course, he would apply a coat of varnish over those words to make them sound regal.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz started churning his imaginary brain matter at full power, but there wasn’t enough time. Albedo had already thrown the ball into his court, he needed to send it back as soon as possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“…It seems like you are misunderstanding something, Albedo. That’s not what I am trying to say.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He decided to be honest. Would it have been better if he put on an act like he usually did?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—yeah, probably.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Anyhow, he managed to protect the image of Ainz Ooal Gown, the absolute ruler of Nazarick, for now.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">…By sacrificing Suzuki Satoru’s heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Albedo made an expression like she realized something. “P-please forgive me for my mistake, Ainz-sama.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">She bowed again in panic.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“No, it’s not like I am angry. You don’t need to bow.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Only scum would enjoy having someone bow their heads for no fault of their own.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“It seems like the term ‘paid vacation’ caused a misunderstanding.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Nazarick did not have salaries or day-offs. It stood at the pinnacle of black companies. Therefore, it was highly likely that she thought the term “paid vacation” was a metaphor for something else. You could say this was Ainz’s fault because he had yet to implement such a system in Nazarick. Of course, Ainz would want to vindicate himself by pointing at the NPCs’ obstinance and demand for more work.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The following was just Suzuki Satoru’s personal experience, but however bad a company might get, employees could usually tolerate a lot as long as their interpersonal relationships were good. On the other hand, if these relationships were bad, it wouldn’t matter how well the company might treat their employees; they tended to break down quickly.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps  Nazarick  was  running  smoothly  because  the  interpersonal relationships between its denizens were great.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“It was a mistake on my part. Forgive me.”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ainz lowered his head as well.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“A-Ainz-sama! Please raise your head!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ainz lifted his head at Albedo’s flustered words.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“…Anyhow, as we have both bowed, can I be considered forgiven?” “There’s no need for Ainz-sama to…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—If there comes a day when I can’t bow to you people, then that day will be the end of me. That person will no longer be me.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Albedo gasped with her eyes wide open and then bowed deeply.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The disturbance by Ainz’s side was likely caused by the twins’ surprise at Albedo’s reaction.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Before Ainz could ask her what the matter was, Albedo lifted her head.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Ainz-sama said that it’s a paid vacation, but is there a plan to head somewhere with the two of them in tow?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">As expected of Albedo.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">To have noticed that Ainz was planning to travel just from the phrase “paid vacation,” Albedo was quite fearsome. If it was Ainz in her shoes, he would have probably said something like, “as the two of them are here, are you planning to spend some leisure time on the Sixth Floor?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“I am planning to head to the Elven country in the south with these two.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“So it’s the Elven country…” Albedo pondered for a while before speaking again, “I see…”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What do you see?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Maybe she was thinking that Ainz was heading over there for diplomacy. He had to make sure.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…don’t be hasty. I am not going there for diplomatic reasons. I just want to observe their state of affairs.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Understood.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">A simple reply. Ainz thought she was going to say more…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was way scarier. He had the feeling that a critical misunderstanding was taking root.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…So I will be going on a journey to the Elven country with these two. If there’s something urgent, contact me with [Message]. I will be back immediately…that’s all there is, alright? I don’t plan on doing anything else, okay? I really, really don’t. Understood?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Understood. So will you be setting out soon?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Y-yes, That’s right” He hadn’t thought that far ahead, but considering the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Theocracy’s advances, it would be better for them if they started early. “I intend to, but Aura and Mare have to prepare right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I think those two will have no issues. If Ainz-sama decided to set out this instant, then it would be natural for them to complete their preparations immediately.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz wanted to reproach her for saying such things, but the twins also concurred with her.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“Mmmmmm—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">If those two were saying that it’s not a problem then it was not Ainz’s place to object.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—I want to be certain about something. Not just Albedo, but Aura and Mare as well. I have a question for all of you. The Great Underground Tomb of Nazarick established the Sorcerer Kingdom, made the Empire its vassal, extended its control over the demihumans of the wildlands, and had just recently destroyed the Re-Estize Kingdom. You could say the size of the organization grew following the expansion of its territory. Well then— I have some apprehensions. Our organization has expanded, but do we have a corresponding expansion in personnel?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">An organization wasn’t something that would stop working just because a person or two were taking a rest.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura and Mare were certainly part of the top brass. If we were to consider Nazarick as a company, they would be its executives. Normal employees could let their peers substitute for them, but executives did not have that luxury. As such, it would be bad if the organization ground to a halt just because the two of them took a rest.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In that case, the plan had to be put on hold and perhaps altered.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—I am worried about that. We might need to take some drastic measures if that’s the case.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I don’t think there will be any problems. And, if it came down to it, there’s always me and Demiurge. If we also have Pandora’s Actor’s cooperation, there will be no issues at all.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I see. As expected of Albedo. So there’s already a solution in place for my misgivings. Splendid work, worthy of being the mo- one of the most intelligent beings in the Nazarick and the holder of the title of Guardian Overseer. Absolutely brilliant. I am highly impressed.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He praised Albedo with all his heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Unlike Ainz, she was diligently managing the organization. If she did not deserve such praise then no one did.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—I am sincerely grateful for your kind words.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Albedo regained her posture after a deep bow, but her expression was a little stiff.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Another question popped into Ainz’s head as this happened.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“It’s Aura and Mare this time…but would everything work without issues if you and Demiurge were the ones to take a vacation?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Albedo faltered for a bit but immediately answered.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I believe that even if we were to be absent, the others would be able to substitute for us without issues. They would do their best to meet Ainz-sama’s expectations.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Ummm…Albedo. It’s not about what you believe. What I want to know is whether or not they could handle it without a problem…of course, it is hard for you to express doubt about the abilities of the Floor Guardians—your comrades, and I do understand that it’s painful for you. But, can you tell me if they can do it, without your emotions getting in the way? If the answer is that they cannot, then we will have to train them and restructure the organization when we have the leeway to do it. Well…if even someone like me could foresee this, Albedo has probably already looked into it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“E-excuse me, Ainz-sama…sorry for interrupting…but.” “What’s the matter, Mare”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Eh, umm, s-sorry but, I am n-not confident about being able to do the a- amazing work that Albedo-san does…”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After a short silence, Albedo’s prickly voice echoed in the hall. “—Is that all you have to say?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">What is this?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He didn’t feel like any of Mare’s words just now warrants Albedo’s anger. In fact, Ainz was in complete agreement with him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Mare!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Mare flinched as Albedo shouted. She was seriously angry.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Before Ainz could stop her, Albedo continued. “Did I hear a Floor Guardian, an elite among elites, say that he can’t do the work that’s expected of him by a Supreme Being?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Albedo!—Don’t be so loud. What’s the problem with someone saying that they cannot do something when that’s the truth? In fact, it would be more of a</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">problem if they say that they can, even when they cannot” “Forgive me for my insolence, but let me continue.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Despite Ainz’s reprimand, Albedo continued in an even louder voice. But, as it seemed like she was no longer directing her anger at Mare, Ainz let her continue. “There’s no problem with someone saying that they can’t do something, but they should also suggest how they could work towards being able to do it! A Floor Guardian cannot be permitted to say that they are unable to do something a</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Supreme Being expected of them and end their words with that.”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Guh, <span class="p">Ainz groaned inside.</span></p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t say that Albedo was wrong. What Mare said was certainly not good from that point of view.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“…Ainz-sama, I think Albedo is right. Mare should retract his words.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Aura said coldly. Being scolded by his own sister, Mare let out some pitiable sounds.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“As a Floor Guardian—”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Stop!” Ainz shouted angrily to stop Albedo from continuing on. Of course, it was just an act, he was not really angry. The fact that his emotional suppression did not kick in was proof of that.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz released his aura along with his voice. He had just used the aura’s visual effect to take control of the conversation, not to debuff others. He chose to use it because he knew Aura, Mare, Albedo, and even Lumière were equipped with items that granted immunity against mental status effects.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t know what Albedo would have said if he let her continue. Maybe she would have gently explained it to Mare later, but as long as there was a chance that it could result in their relationship breaking down, Ainz could not stand aside.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Mare. What Albedo said is reasonable. If you express your inability to do something you should also suggest ways to remedy it.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“P-please forgive me.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Be that as it may, Albedo. Don’t you think there is a problem with a superior who forces their subordinates into doing something they are unable to?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“…I cannot say there are no problems”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I think both of you were at fault this time. I am glad for your loyalty, but anyone could make a mistake. You have to be gentle in correcting them the first time around so that they won’t hide their mistakes or repeat them.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Honestly, Albedo was just too loyal and too able, so she tended to be hard on</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">others. He thought the only reason it didn’t cause any major problems up till this point was because he rejected most of her suggestions on how to deal with others. If Albedo ever received full authority, it would probably end in wide-scale purges.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Although I think that’s a groundless fear…maybe…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Yes. I felt like I was a bit too angry as well. Forgive me, Mare.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Eh, Ah, no, there’s no need. Albedo-san was right. …I was in the wrong. I am terribly sorry.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">After they bowed to each other (with Mare taking a deeper bow from the waist), this incident could be considered resolved for now.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…So, where were we at? Ah, that’s right. As I will be heading to the Elven country for a paid vacation with these two, I want the twins to make sure that their substitutes will be in place. First of all, transfer your work to the substitutes within three days. If possible…entrust it to the Area Guardians under you instead of the Floor Guardians. If that’s not possible—”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz thought it would be hard for Albedo, as it has been only a short while since the destruction of the Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Discuss it with Pandora’s Actor, all right?” He got an energetic reply from them.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“So what about Ainz-sama’s retinue? Will it be Hanzos?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That’s not a bad idea, or rather, Hanzos were just too convenient to use. To be honest, he wanted to summon more if money and data weren’t an issue. The Hanzo mercenaries’ data was used up, but there was data for other ninja-type monsters in the library still. It would be great if he could use those but—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">—I would rather not use the assets in the treasury if possible, so I’ll have to bear with this until I can save up enough personal wealth. Or, should I prioritize strengthening Nazarick defenses first? I should think about this on the way to the Elven country. Aaah, I want money…Money I am free to use however I want…I wonder if there’s someone with some treasure stashed away. The kind of person who can’t complain even if I steal it.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“…Ainz-sama?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Hmm? …Ah, sorry. It seems like I was lost in thought for quite a while. About the retinue—”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz stopped himself before saying “Hanzos will do.” It was generally said that excellent employees were all good at reading the mood. Although Ainz was a mediocre employee, perhaps he had rolled a crit just for this moment, because</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">his intuition told him to shut his mouth for a moment.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It is because he managed to read some slightly different emotions than usual in Albedo’s tone.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—No, I did not originally plan to take Hanzos along, but is there some work you wanted the Hanzos to do?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Ah, no, as you don’t plan to take Hanzos this time, it’s not my place to object to Ainz-sama’s decision…” Albedo hesitated for a bit as she tried to read Ainz’s mood from his face. “Some have been vocally complaining that the Hanzos were the only ones being called upon so much…there are a lot of people who want to work for Ainz-sama, so I wanted to ask if they could be given a chance.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">As Ainz started to contemplate it, Albedo immediately shook her hands in a fluster.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“It’s already good enough that Ainz-sama is now aware that there are people eager to serve given the chance.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz mentally facepalmed while responding with an “umu.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz—Suzuki Satoru was just an ordinary person, so he never imagined that such a problem could exist.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He was using the Hanzos a lot, for sure, but to let others have such an impression was pretty bad.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Favoritism would always exist within a company. It was natural that it would be easier for people who were liked by their superiors to be promoted even if their talent was a little inferior compared to their colleagues. That said, favoritism would cause the social relations inside the company to worsen.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That was not good. Was he not just thinking that even though Nazarick was a black company, it was somehow running smoothly because of the strength of its internal social relations?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t say, “I will just take the Hanzos” in such a situation.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Well, let’s just decide the retinue later—no, we should at least inform them soon. It’ll be interesting to see who I choose and how you prepare so that my choice wouldn’t matter, don’t you think?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz gave a smile, while feeling entirely different in his heart.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Albedo bowed her head with an expression that said, “I see. As expected of Ainz-sama”.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Understood. I will immediately inform all the denizens of Nazarick.” “Umu. I am relying on you.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Ainz stood up and left the room with only Lumière following him. He then let</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">out a large sigh like a salaryman who had just ended his workday.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 204pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♦ ♦ ♦</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Albedo lifted her head on hearing the door close and her eyes met with the other two who had lifted their heads at the same time.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“About that, Albedo. I want to ask you something.” “What is it?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Albedo responded as she stood up.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Although  Ainz-sama  said  he  is  visiting  the  Elven  country  on  paid vacation…what do you think is his goal? There’s no way he is just thinking about enjoying himself right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“—of course.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Eh? I-is that so?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The supreme ruler of Nazarick, Ainz Ooal Gown, was a wise king whose every single move might contain many meanings behind it. One should think there were at least three goals behind each of them.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One’s position as a king was not a thing to be taken lightly. It’s not like a coat that one could don and doff according to their mood. Even if he said that he was on vacation—even if the other countries believed it—he was still the illustrious king of the Sorcerer Kingdom at the end of the day. Each and every movement of his could be thought of as having the Sorcerer Kingdom’s agenda behind them. Any idiot could understand that.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Therefore, it stood to reason that there was another meaning hidden in his act of taking a paid vacation to the Elven country.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Then what do you think Ainz-sama’s goal is?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“As he mentioned, improving the organization was probably a part of it, but collecting intel is probably the main goal.” Albedo said as she pondered. “I think Demiurge could probably give a better answer…the Theocracy should be deploying a large-scale offensive against the Elven country right about now.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Y-you mean that T-theocracy?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Information regarding the Theocracy was circulated around Nazarick, so there was no need to explain the fundamentals.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Yes. After finding out that their hypothetical enemy, the Sorcerer Kingdom, has entered into conflict with the Kingdom, they would naturally try to finish</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">their war with the Elves once and for all.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Because it would be bad to fight on two fronts, right?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“That’s right. Although the Theocracy is not at war with us right now, considering the future situation, it’s best not to divide their forces between the northern and the southern fronts. In that case, it’s highly likely that they are moving out a large force to attack the Elven country. It’s hard to think they will have peace talks at this point, but I am not sure.”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">For Albedo, it was not a problem if the Elven country was destroyed by the Theocracy. On the contrary, it was even better for them if the Theocracy enslaved the Elves so that they could gain the great Casus Belli to liberate the Elves. That could increase the amount of options they had against the Theocracy, but it seems like their Master thought differently of the situation. Perhaps he was going there because he wanted to gain more information before making a decision.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Demiurge would have probably answered with certainty if he was here.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Albedo had a leg up over Demiurge when it came to internal affairs, but she had to concede to him on military issues. She had always lost to Demiurge in that subject. While this thought formed in her head, she tilted her head wondering why Demiurge was so silent regarding this matter.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Is Demiurge making moves while keeping it a secret from us? Is he planning something by collecting intel on the situation within the Elven country secretly? I don’t think that’s the case but…</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As Demiurge often worked outside of Nazarick, he received more discretionary powers compared to the other Floor Guardians. Or rather, it was more accurate to say that the other guardians didn’t use their privileges as much. That said, he always described the information collected and his actions in very detailed reports (which always ended up being hefty and a bother to read) to their master, which passed through her. That was why Albedo believed that he couldn’t be up to something without her noticing it since she didn’t receive any reports regarding the Elven country.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Considering Demiurge’s personality, it’s unlikely that he was hiding things. He probably just didn’t get around to doing it yet.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">However, the truth was she couldn’t be completely sure about it.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She should probably go and meet him immediately after leaving this place. No—she should summon him over. She shouldn’t have the talk in his domain, but if she had her subordinates wait at their side during their talk, it was likely</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">that Demiurge would try to sound out her intentions.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But if he was to bring his devils along…no, would he even take such short-sighted actions? Is he doubting me? He hasn’t made a move yet so the problem is—</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“A-are we going to fight the Theocracy?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Eh? Ah, yes, about that. We don’t know if it will happen. Maybe even Ainz- sama isn’t sure and that’s why he is using a paid vacation as an excuse.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Albedo quickly replied in a fluster, jolted out of her thoughts by Mare’s question. Even though she pondered for quite a while, there was no suspicion in the twins’ eyes. She decided to save her thoughts on Demiurge for later.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps this time their master was thinking of traveling not as the ruler of Nazarick, but just as an undead on a paid vacation. That way, even if the worst were to happen, the damage to Nazarick would be minimized.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Maybe just this once, there were some elements that even Ainz-sama wasn’t sure of, so he is trying to make moves independent of Nazarick.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“No way!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Eeeh? You are t-talking about that Ainz-sama, y-you know?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The two elves raised their voices, filled with surprise, and looked at Albedo with eyes filled with disbelief.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Their master’s wisdom had managed to read and control everything until now. They saw many times when one of his unremarkable moves ended up being the fatal strike for the opponent. According to what they’ve heard, he already had a general idea of the next thousand years and was making moves accordingly.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was natural to doubt Albedo, who said that their Master could be uncertain about something.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“…As expected, even Albedo couldn’t completely read through our master’s intentions——”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Albedo directed a bitter smile at Aura, who spoke with her hands crossed behind her head.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“First of all, it’s impossible for anyone to see the depths of Ainz-sama’s great plans. That is something I have experienced repeatedly till now…frankly speaking, I still don’t understand the reason why Ainz-sama used the word “paid vacation”. Just keep in mind that as you are going to the Elven country, it’s highly likely that you will have to face the Theocracy.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The two guardians nodded with serious expressions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“A-are we allowed to take along our own subordinates…” “Other than those selected by Ainz-sama you mean…”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Albedo considered Mare’s suggestion. While it could be taken as an affront to their master, it could also possibly make him happy that they prepared some on their own.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“If Ainz sama wants a small elite force…no, wait,” Albedo started to consider the matter on a deeper level.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Select a group for the smaller retinue and another one in case it’s large, tentatively…on my side I will discuss with Demiurge about Ainz-sama’s goals and inform you later.”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The way Ainz-sama was extremely worried about the deterioration of Nazarick’s organizational capacity. Is that also one of the factors this time?</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Upon informing him that there was nothing to worry about, she was answered with sarcastic praise. It was probably because of her failure to understand the full extent of his unease and her inability to answer the trust placed in her.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He was especially worried about that point…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">For the time being, they had acquired someone who rivaled them in terms of intelligence to work under them. Did he intend to say that even that is not enough? Or was it something else…</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Albedo spoke after she heard the twins’ acknowledging her suggestions.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I think we will get a hint of Ainz-sama’s intentions from his choice of personnel for the retinue…but I expect the work this time to be of an extremely high level. Take notice of everything without lowering your guard and keep your wits about you at all times.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The two guardians gave a spirited response to Albedo.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Considering their combat strength, she was sure that they would be able to protect their master, but one should never be careless.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">She should discuss with Demiurge and prepare for the total mobilization of Nazarick just in case.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Even though it will slow down dealing with the remnants of the Kingdom, we should prepare for it just to be sure</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Albedo left the room with the other two while arranging the order of her duties inside her head.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s36" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">0</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"/><p class="s37" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 15pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark14">r</a><span class="s38">&lt;</span>r,<a name="bookmark17">&zwnj;</a></p><p class="s39" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">:::c</p><p class="s40" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">r­</p><p class="s41" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 7pt;text-align: left;">e</p><p class="s39" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">:::c</p><p class="s42" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 6pt;text-align: left;">C,</p><p class="s43" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 437pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 8pt;text-align: left;">r ,</p><p class="s44" style="text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 9pt;text-align: right;">1<span style=" color: #312F24;">5</span></p><p class="s46" style="padding-left: 437pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 4pt;text-align: left;">L <span class="s47">.J</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s48" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 12pt;text-align: left;">CJ</p><p class="s49" style="padding-left: 439pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;">0</p><p class="s50" style="padding-left: 441pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 5pt;text-align: left;">CL</p><p class="s51" style="padding-left: 440pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 88%;text-align: left;">:<span class="s52">t</span>:<span class="s52">:</span>:<span class="s52">-</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s53" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 72pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">C<span style=" color: #110F0A;">h</span>a<span style=" color: #110F0A;">pt</span>e<span style=" color: #110F0A;">r 2 </span><span class="s55">Nazarick-style Traveling Experience</span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><span><img width="644" height="925" alt="image" src="Overlord%20Volume%2015%20-%20The%20Half-Elf%20God-kin%20Part%20I_files/Image_008.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;"><a name="bookmark15">Chapter 2 | Nazarick-style Traveling Experience</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">1</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It could be said that there were no chokepoints in the Great Forest of Evasha where the elves reside. There were certainly places with dangerous monsters, small nations of demihumans, and impossible labyrinths, but there were no structures that could be called a fortress or impassable physical barriers. However, there existed a place that could be called a chokepoint.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was the work of a single person.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The Holocaust Scripture’s vice-captain, Schoen, tried looking ahead of him while he hid behind the scattered trees.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There sat a girl of around 8 years old who looked even younger than her age would suggest, as Elves tended to.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She was sitting on a small chair on top of a slight incline, holding a bow too large for her. There was a quiver beside the chair with a few arrows poking out of it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There were fewer arrows in that small quiver than could be counted with both hands, but they were informed beforehand that the arrows would never run out. There was no doubt that it was a magic item.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">No one was around except for the girl.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">…That was what scared him.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A hero could overturn the tides of battle by themselves. You could say that one of them was equal to an army of ten thousand. In fact, this girl in front of him had already taken over a thousand lives from the Theocracy’s army.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">An army of 40,000 was being nailed down by a single girl sitting primly on a chair.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The recommended strategy in such situations was to move around the obstacle. It wasn’t like they had to break through from here. The great forest itself was a natural barrier but it was not impossible to take a detour.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That said, the opponent was not an army, but a single combatant. It was easy to take note of an enemy’s movements if they were in large numbers, but this girl was more than just an exceptional combatant. As an individual, she would also be more mobile than their army. Once they lost sight of her, it would be hard to find her again. If an enemy capable of fighting an army alone was left to their own devices in the dark depths of the great forest—there was no need to say that the vanguard’s morale would take a plunge.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They could also try and delay her by pinning her down with a small force while letting the larger force advance. That was not exactly a bad idea, except for the fact that it was idiotic to divide their forces in a hostile land.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">So, it could be said that this was their best chance: while the opponent was deployed (although, it’s doubtful if sitting on a chair could be considered as deployment) like this. The top brass decided that she should be dealt with while they knew of her location, even if they had to sacrifice some of their forces.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Only a hero could stand against a hero” goes the aphorism. Nothing would be solved by sending in the riff-raff.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There were no heroes within the Theocracy’s invasion army this time, so it fell to the Holocaust Scripture to deal with this.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But there were no heroes in the Holocaust Scripture either. There used to be one, but he was transferred to the Black Scripture. In the Theocracy, anybody who stepped into the realm of heroes would be moved to the Black Scripture.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, Schoen is yet to step into that realm.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Despite that, they were sent to this battlefield because it was widely believed that the Holocaust Scripture could take down a hero when they worked as a team.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">And that’s true.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The Holocaust Scripture can kill heroes.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But, there was a large difference between those who just stepped into the realm of heroes and those who were nearly outliers. Even if they could win against the former, it was impossible for them to triumph against the latter. That was why Schoen was observing the girl seriously.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Common soldiers, stronger soldiers, elite soldiers, heroes, and outliers… Schoen, who had seen beings of various levels, had enough knowledge and intelligence to measure her strength accurately and minimize their casualties as much as possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Although not comparable to the Black Scripture, the members selected for the Holocaust Scripture were elites in their own right (but you could say the same for any of the six scriptures). He didn’t want them to be killed for no reason.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Depending on her strength, he might have to give the order to sacrifice some soldiers to hold her back while they waited for the Black Scripture to get dispatched from the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schoen slowly let out a slow, long breath.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Though he was hiding behind the trees with [Invisibility] and [Silence]— [Silence] was not originally an arcane spell, but this version was developed for use by magic casters—he still had to be mindful even when taking a breath.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wanted to wipe the sweat off his forehead, but considering any of his movements could lead to certain death, he chose not to. Schoen might be a talented caster, but he was only a little better than the ordinary person at stealth without using magic.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf girl was probably a ranger or an archer. If it was the former, it was possible for her to sense Schoen even though he was being hidden by magic. She might not know his exact location, but she could just use an area-of-effect attack—which she was confirmed to be able to do—to smoke him out.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Schoen wouldn’t die from a single attack even if the opponent was a hero, but he was not confident in escaping smoothly if he was wounded.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even more than his fear of death, Schoen was afraid that he might die in vain without bringing back the intel he collected.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">—But she really was an unpleasant brat</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">She hadn’t made a single move since he started observing her. Her glazed expression makes her look like a doll.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But, Schoen knew she was a living being, not a doll.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">After an unknown amount of time since he started his observation, the target finally moved.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schoen’s heart flinched, worrying if the target found him at last.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">However, the target did not look at him, but that didn’t mean he could let down his guard. For people who honed their skills to their limits, it was child’s play to feint with their eyes. In fact, Schoen knew that such a skill actually existed.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">With his hearing strengthened by [Elephant Ear], he soon heard a large group of people approaching from behind. They were likely the ones his target noticed.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He was sure that they were his peers—soldiers of the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Schoen suddenly felt guilty, because he knew the reason why they were sent here.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He would not warn them, because that’s what his duty demanded.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Still, he would not leave anything unobserved. That was all he could do.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The target’s true strength could only be understood if they saw her fight.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Those soldiers were the sacrifices the top brass sent for that purpose.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They were going to sacrifice the valuable lives of their comrades. Schoen turned to look behind him, making sure he would not get noticed by the target. His eyes, strengthened by the second-tier magic [Hawk-eye], spotted an arrow flying over.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The lone arrow bent around the trees in its path and then, it scattered into multiple arrows mid-air, turning into a rain of arrows that covered a large area.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The arrow was not probably aimed at anything specific. Even if she could locate her target through sound, this was in the middle of the forest. It was impossible to snipe accurately with all the trees around. But something like a [Fireball] would be able to burn beyond these obstructions. She was just emulating it by combining the ability to weave through the gaps between the trees with the ability to multiply the arrows.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Schoen’s strengthened ears picked up cries of pain from the soldiers. It seemed like no one was left unscathed.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—cries? They are still alive?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The soldiers milled about in confusion, fearing the arrows that came from beyond their vision. As no one managed to figure out the trajectory the arrows flew in, everyone started to run hither-thither. There was no fighting spirit left in them.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They weren’t exactly doing the wrong thing. In fact, it could be said they were responding correctly by scattering around randomly, which would let at least a few of them survive.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The girl fired another arrow.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It weaved through the spaces between trees again and then multiplied. Among the rain of arrows, the sounds of pitiful cries and trampled undergrowth gradually came to a halt.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He learned one important thing as a result of the deaths of these soldiers.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She couldn’t kill an ordinary soldier in a single attack. Of course, considering the ability—martial art—that made the arrows multiply, it stood to reason that each arrow would have reduced precision and damage. That said, a hero could kill every one of those regular soldiers with a single attack. It could mean only one thing.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">—She isn’t a hero. That brat didn’t step into the realm of heroes</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That was Schoen’s conclusion.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was because he worked hard to match his rival, the third seat of the Black Scripture, “Earth, Wind &amp; Fire (ft. Water)”, that he could be sure of his conclusion.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">(T/N: Third seat’s title should be “The Four Elements”, the same kanji as Inveria’s traditions)</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">She was weaker than Schoen, but that didn’t mean they could be at ease.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The fighting styles of a magic caster and an archer are strong in their own ways. Even if he was stronger than her in general, the battle could still go either way. It was also possible that she was hiding her true strength after realizing she was under observation.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But, Schoen, the observer in question, could say with certainty that she didn’t notice yet.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">There was only one thing left for them to do. Remove the obstacle in the path of the Theocracy’s advance.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He activated [Silent Magic - Wall of Protection from Arrows].</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t feel like that was enough preparation, but she might notice something suspicious and escape. if he tried to do more at this distance.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He can only strengthen his resolve. [Silent Maximized Magic - Magic Arrow].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He came out of hiding from behind the tree and activated his abilities at the same time. He also activated the once-per-day trump card of the Arcane Devotee class that Holocaust Scripture required its members to acquire. He used it to access the spell-strengthening metamagics he had yet to learn. Naturally, he chose [Triplet Magic].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">A total of twelve magic arrows flew out at the same time.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">One could not escape from these arrows, but unfortunately, the damage of a single arrow was not enough. As long as there’s not much difference between the strengths of the opponent and the caster, it would be hard to kill them even with [Maximize Magic]. But—that was only true if he was fighting alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">All of his subordinates were observing Schoen’s movements with [See Invisibility].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Their target’s expression changed in an instant.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps it was because she was in pain from Schoen’s attack, or perhaps it was because she saw the hundred plus [Magic Arrows] coming at her from behind Schoen.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Holocaust Scripture was entrusted with assassination and counter-terrorism work that required them to be flexible, so their teams consisted of at least four members, each with different jobs. This was similar to the adventurers’ tactics in the Kingdom and the Empire. As the adventurers’ guilds were in fact created secretly by the Theocracy, you could even call them brothers-in-arms. The tactic this time relied upon a team consisting of one common class. On top of that, only those who could use a specific skill were selected. The end result was a team of magic casters who could also use [Invisibility].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Hit. Hit. Hit. Hit.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was like wings of light flew across the sky.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The target collapsed on the ground and laid still with her face down. Even so, only Schoen approached her.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t think the target, who was an archer, could use it, but there were illusions that could make one appear dead. He can’t let his guard down yet.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He put his foot under her body and flipped her around.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There was not a single part of the child’s body that was without wounds from being hit by their magic arrows. Schoen took a closer look at her face. There was no light in the eyes that peeked out from under her swollen eyelids.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">She was dead for sure.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Huh. —Right back at you, you shitty brat”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They didn’t select [Magic Arrow] just so that it could be an act of symbolic revenge. People like rangers with keen senses could sometimes sense and escape from damage if they were attacked with area-of-effect spells.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Mental attacks were situationally effective at dealing fatal damage in a single blow, but there was a high probability that it would just get nullified. So, since he had others to back him up, he chose to use a method that was guaranteed to hit the opponent.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Be that as it may, it was still the best spell they could have used to take revenge for the soldiers killed by her arrows.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Schoen wrinkled his brows at the dead child’s face. He felt like there was a hint of tranquility in it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Maybe he was just mistaken, but if he wasn’t, that would be extremely irritating. This elf killed nearly a thousand of his comrades from Theocracy, so he wanted her to die in painful agony, regretting her actions at the end.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Schoen stopped himself before he could spit on her corpse. He had to get the equipment off of her first. He planned to do it here as there were no enemies around. He would probably feel disgusted if he had to touch his own saliva in the process, so he should spit after he took them off her.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">First, the bow.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It was the weapon of an opponent who managed to stop the Theocracy’s army by herself. It should be something good.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Good grief.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Schoen suddenly went stiff upon hearing the nonchalant voice of a man. Although he should have responded immediately, the suddenness shocked him to a stop. Turning to look at the source of the voice, Schoen found a single elf.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">There wasn’t supposed to be anyone here, there was no mistake about that. There should be no elves other than the target present. He even took care to use [See invisibility] while approaching the target.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Human, did you know? That fighting with the strong, with one’s life on the line, is the fastest way to become stronger? Though I took her away from her mother and threw her into the battle immediately, thinking that she was a success…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The voice sounded disappointed. The elf looked at the girl’s dead body with scorn. “You useless shit. You are even worse than the other failures for wasting my time. As I thought, people who can’t bring forth the king’s essence are no different than trash”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Schoen already understood who the elf was.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">His heterochromatic eyes were clear enough proof. The final target of the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">A deplorable criminal. It was the Elf king.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">An existence that even heroes couldn’t win against, never mind Schoen.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Someone above even the Outliers. There was no chance of victory. [Silent Magic - Invisibility]</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Shoen panicked, immediately activated the spell, and moved a short distance. Yet, the Elf king’s eyes followed him. Even though he just moved a short distance from the place where he cast [Invisibility], the elf king clearly saw him. The moment he realized that, Schoen ran with his back turned to the Elf king.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He can’t hide the grass being trampled by him even if he was using [Invisibility] and [Silence], but he couldn’t stop running.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Still, the elf king didn’t shift his gaze even a bit from Schoen. It didn’t seem like he was using [See Invisibility] to see him perfectly. He was seeing through [Invisibility] and [Silence] with just his extraordinary sight. That was why Schoen had to create some distance between them. If the opponent was not using anti-stealth abilities to find him, only increasing the space between them would make it easier to hide.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">For just a moment, he regretted not using [Fly] to escape, but he couldn’t do it anyway because of one of the classes he acquired.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Adepts of Surshana had a special ability with a limited number of uses per day. This ability allowed them to extend the effective time of a spell by consuming their mana. Taking advantage of that ability, he had already exhausted most of his mana to maintain his other spells; therefore, he did not have enough mana to effectively use [Fly].</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Also, one would have to be mad to use [Fly] as it made them defenseless while within the reach of the Elf king. Schoen wasn’t that desperate yet. It was more practical to use it after he could get far away enough and hide among the trees.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“—Hah”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He heard the Elf king scoff behind him.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“It’s meaningless to kill you people but—I went through all this trouble to come here, so I might as well do it to relieve my boredom.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">As a magic caster, Schoen wasn’t exactly skilled at moving his body. Even so, as someone who stood at the boundary to the realm of heroes, he could cross vast distances with little effort. After Schoen managed to get far enough away, the Elf king’s voice suddenly echoed in his ears, which were strengthened by</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">[Elephant Ear].</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Go—Kill everyone, Behemoth”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The land shook around him. He understood that something huge had appeared without needing to look.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Disperse!” He shouted, canceling [Silence] so that his voice could reach his subordinates.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He had never shouted so loud in his entire life. If the Elf king grimaced a bit at this, then it’s even better.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He needed his subordinates to do their best now, even if it meant throwing away some people’s lives as sacrifices. Getting the intel back home was the only way to recompense the lost lives.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Schoen, who was nearest to the elf king, would certainly die. So he turned back.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If he died before his subordinates, that would be a good thing in itself.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had seen Earth Elementals before. They were weird chubby-looking things, smaller than humans and with arms too large for their bodies. But, the one that stood before him was not such a cute thing.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">A misshapen body made of boulders and mineral ore, and as large as the trees around it, enough to make one call it the Earth Elemental Lord.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Thick and long arms with stout but short legs. Maybe it would have looked comical if it was much smaller, but its arms and legs displayed power that no monster should be capable of. The elf king stood behind it, looking at Schoen’s desperate struggle with a sneer.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">His attitude was absolutely disgusting.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Someone who took lives without betting his own.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Unconcerned about things like Schoen’s anger, the Elf king immediately closed the gap between them with graceful movements as if he was skating over ice. The Earth Elemental—Behemoth, lifted its two giant arms high into the air.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—try me, you piece of shit! [Wall of Stone]”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">A stone wall was erected between the Elf king and him.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">In the very next moment, it was broken with a single strike, with its pieces melting away into the air.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Though there were other factors, the strength and durability of a wall tended to be proportional to the caster’s strength. Even so—no, maybe it showed that the Elemental summoned by the Elf king was just that strong.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Behemoth immediately lifted its left fist.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Schoen saw the Elf king standing there with a satisfied grin from the corner of</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">his vision and understood what he was thinking. He knew what would happen. He was probably thinking that Schoen would die from the next attack.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He was certainly not wrong.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">The Behemoth’s fist will reach Schoen before he could cast another spell, and then he will die.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Even so—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">I managed to buy some time</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">He wasted his opponent’s time, even if it was only a few moments, but that is enough.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">It was more than enough.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">At least one person would survive to return to the Theocracy because of this.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It’s a defeat for Schoen, but not for the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">In the next moment, Schoen was turned into pulp by Behemoth’s fist, with a smile on his face till the very end.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 204pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♦ ♦ ♦</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The Elf king—Decem Hougan, passed through his castle gate, letting out a sigh from feeling unpleasant.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It took too much time to return to the castle which put him in a bad mood.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">By riding the indefatigable Behemoth, he likely returned in the fastest way possible. Even so, wasting time was a bore and he hated the stress it gave him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Retrieving the weapons he gave to his failed creation was certainly not a waste of time—he should in fact be praised for it. The gear he gave her were things he received from his father, things that no one else could make. He could not let them fall into the hands of humans who couldn’t understand their value.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But, the problem was that there was no one else who could complete such an important task.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t have underlings who he could entrust such issues with. It was because all of them were weak.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">All of them were useless.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Elves were a splendid race. His father was the proof of that fact, that they were a race that could become stronger than anyone else. If Decem was a special type of Elf like a High Elf or an Elf Lord, he would have concluded that the others were just worse and that would be the end of it. However, that wasn’t the case. His</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">father was also just an Elf. This meant any Elf could become strong. That’s why he couldn’t understand why the others were so weak. How could he prove that Elves were the greatest race?</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He just had to achieve something that others could see.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He just had to make this world the dominion of the Elves—of him who held such a revered bloodline.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He required excellent—strong females for that.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(T/N: he’s got the incel mentality, if that wasn’t obvious enough)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But, he couldn’t be sure which females had superior wombs until the children were nurtured. So, he sent all of his children to fight in the war but almost none of them managed to return.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He was bothered by the fact that even after doing this for such a long time, he had no results to show for it.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A female approached Decem, who looked quite menacing as he thought about various things.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—my king” “What is it?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He directed his simmering anger at the female and then slightly widened his eyes with surprise.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A strong person’s (i.e. Decem’s) stare contained within it strong emotions— especially if it was filled with hostility or the intent to kill. As a result, it tended to break weaker beings. Yes, he didn’t direct his killing intent at her, only his anger. Even so, weaker beings should still be affected and though this female went pale, she withstood it.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">She was just supposed to be a weak female.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In that case, how did she withstand his aura? Perhaps it was because he was exhausted. He didn’t really care but he should reward her for being able to withstand it.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">So, he stopped to look at her. Decem was a merciful lord. “How is that child?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Who is “that child” supposed to be? What exactly was she thinking by asking him such meaningless questions instead of first thanking the king for his hard work after a long trip? He lost his motivation immediately.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“I am asking about Roogi” Roogi.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He didn’t remember such a name.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Decem can’t really remember names, because there was almost no one who was worthy enough to be remembered by him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">From his point of view, remembering useless names was a waste of memory. It’s not that his memory was limited, but there’s no meaning to using his memory for unimportant things. In fact, he couldn’t understand why so many people try to memorize useless things.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The female shifted her gaze to the bow in Decem’s hands. “So, she died”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Something clicked in him. It was about that failure, the one who managed to die even though he gave her such precious weapons. He felt ashamed that half of the blood that flowed in her veins was his own. No—rather, it was because it was not more than half that she got killed by someone like humans.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Yeah, she died” “Is…that so”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Her voice trembled.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She was also probably feeling ashamed upon remembering that her blood flowed through that failed creation, but that failure was still stronger than her. This female should be even more ashamed.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But it was the king’s duty to give people a chance.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Decem felt moved at how gentle a king he was that he would show mercy even for the incompetent.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Come to my room later. I will give you another chance”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Decem started walking without waiting for a reply. He should get these weapons to the treasury first.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After he returned from the treasury, Decem washed off the dirt from the battlefield and laid on the bed in his room.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">While he was waiting like that, a man came requesting his permission to enter.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: -11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t see that female anywhere behind him. “…What is it?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“I have information for the king. The woman summoned by the king, named Myuugi, has committed suicide”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Suicide?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Yes. She did it by jumping from the castle”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“What? She died from falling from just that height…no, I forget that you people are only that strong”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">Decem pondered for a bit. He couldn’t think of a reason for her suicide. First</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">of all, he had just summoned her to his bed, so she should have been joyful. Maybe it’s not suicide, but instead, she got murdered by someone who envied her.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“…Are you sure that it’s a suicide?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Yes. We are sure, as there was someone who saw her do it.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Decem thought for a moment that maybe that witness was the murderer, but if it really was a suicide, what could have been the reason? After he mulled it over for a while, Decem finally found the answer.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“I see… So it’s something like that. I understand now. She was sorry for giving birth to a useless daughter and killed herself as an apology, right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Only she can know her true feelings, but you are probably right, my king” The man replied with an expressionless face.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“…In that case, give her a fitting funeral. She used her life to apologize after all. It’s a king’s duty to forgive others”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“I am grateful for my king’s merciful consideration”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Decem nodded regally at the man who was bowing deeply. As he thought, kings should be merciful like this to useless beings.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Feeling extremely compassionate, Decem decided to reward the loyal man— he didn’t remember his name—in front of him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Do you have any daughters?” “…Yes…I do”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“You are fortunate. Send them here if they are already of age. If they aren’t, your wife works too”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The man looked like he was deeply moved. After his body shook all over, he spoke like he was trying to squeeze the words out.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Understood, my king…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He left the room and Decem proceeded to forget about that female. He didn’t care about what happened to some useless female.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p class="s32" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 79pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><a name="bookmark16">2</a></p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Above the great forest sprawling far south from the Sorcerer Kingdom, to the south of the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz stared at the land below with the winds raging around him.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“So this is what they call the Great Forest. It’s more like a sea of trees…yes, The Great Sea of Trees.”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Due to it being nighttime and the deepness of the greenery that extended below him, it looked like it was painted black. When the winds brushed the canopy, waves rippled out just like the sea. He felt like this was the land most suitable to be called The Great Sea of Trees. In fact, this forest was larger than the Great Forest of Tob and the Azerlisia Mountain Range put together. It might even be larger than the entire Kingdom.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">This is The Great Sea of Trees from now as far as the Sorcerer Kingdom is concerned <span class="p">This outrageously large forest had no landmarks to speak of as far as he could see. Various species should have built independent civilizations that changed the surroundings to suit their lifestyles in this forest, but he did not find any signs of</span></p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">those changes from the sky.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">—Maybe they are being hidden by the canopy. Their civilizations probably developed to hide themselves from the sky because there are monsters that can fly</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">But, he did discover two things.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">One was the crescent-shaped lake that was said to be the location of the Elven capital. He discovered it comparatively quickly due to its large size.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">The other one was the earthen road that extended from the Theocracy.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">It was artificially made by clearing the forest for the advance of the Theocracy’s armies.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">It looked like a thread compared to the gigantic forest around it, but it should</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">be over 100 meters wide. He shouldn’t be able to see it from the sky if it wasn’t at least that wide. He thought that was a lot of useless work, but there was probably no other way for them to establish a level of safety in this giant forest. Considering the amount of time and labor that road would have required, one could feel the Theocracy’s obsession with wiping out the Elven country.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But I can’t understand it at all. Why is this the only thing that stands out? Did the Theocracy stop its advance?</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If they wanted to destroy the Elven villages, wasn’t felling the trees and then creating forest fires the best way to do it? The forest was not dry but it wasn’t very humid either. Destroying the Elven villages should be easy as long as they took care of their surroundings when they start the fires.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">They want to take the Elves as slaves so they are not burning them down? In that case, it seems like the theocracy isn’t that pressed…Maybe there’s just that much of a difference between the strength of their forces</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t find any burned patches of forest from the sky, but he couldn’t be sure considering he was far above the land. Perhaps Aura would have noticed if she was here.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">And that bunch of lights over there should be the Theocracy’s vanguard camp…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Humans couldn’t see in the dark, so the larger their encampment, the more likely it was bright enough to be seen from far away.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But, due to various reasons—especially his position in the sky—it was hard to get a good idea of the distance between the camp and the capital. He had no idea how long it would take the army to reach the capital if they proceeded in a straight line while clearing the forest.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz believed that he had seen all he needed to see, so he activated [Greater Teleportation].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was easy to be seen from the ground if he stayed in the sky without any cover. There were many people with superior vision, so he certainly couldn’t be careless even though it was night.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Of course, if the other side noticed him, he could easily escape before they could climb the height of thousands of meters to reach him. Still, there was no merit in letting others know about his presence here. So, Ainz did not dispel [Perfect Unknowable].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">From Ainz’s analysis of the information he gathered, most of the living beings in this world were weak.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Yet, he couldn’t say with certainty that there was no one equal to him in</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">regions he had no information on. He should proceed while assuming that “maybe” they do exist. Since the enemy can prepare countermeasures if information regarding him was leaked, a card of his exposed was a step closer to his defeat.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">…Well then, the next should be the Elven capital</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—Deep in the night.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The forest was gloomy with very little moonlight, but that was not an issue to Ainz. He came down from the sky using [Fly], using it to float just above the ground so that he wouldn’t step on the undergrowth and advanced towards his target.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He already understood how far the Theocracy’s army had advanced. Next, he had to collect information in the Elven Royal Capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The space before him opened up gradually.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Elven houses were made from short and stout trees called Elf Trees and the Royal Capital where a large number of them were gathered looked like a forest. The construction was the same as in any other Elven village, but it was especially striking when they were gathered in such large numbers. Maybe it was because they were denser in the capital, but it was overwhelming enough to pressure even him. Ainz felt like avoiding the place because it reminded him of his former gray- tinted world.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The trees were cleared around the Royal Capital and instead converted into a large field of grass.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That was not a natural phenomenon, but something the Elves did for the capital’s defense. It was made to provide better visibility, making it harder for an enemy to approach the capital without being seen.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But on the other hand, maybe this could also be considered as the Elf Tree’s survival strategy</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He initially didn’t feel anything strange when he heard that the Elves grew Elf Trees with magic, but perhaps instead, the Elf Trees were using the Elves to multiply themselves.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He could imagine Elf Trees as a kind of monster. He should probably investigate this more to find out if they were intelligent.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz tried to see ahead of him as he thought about how to investigate this and whether or not he should entrust it to Mare.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">There should be guards on the lookout, surveying the cover-less grasslands. It would be hard to break through without using magic.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">That said, it should be possible for an Aura-level ranger. High-level rangers had the ability to stay hidden even if there was no cover. If the level difference between them was large enough, it was possible for the observer to not notice anything out of place even if they met eyes with the ranger. He had heard from Aura that the stealth capabilities of a highly-skilled ranger was good enough to make you think that they were nothing but a pebble by the road, but Ainz had his doubts about the veracity of that claim. He had experimented on their journey here by having Aura go into hiding, but Ainz was more or less able to detect Aura when she didn’t use any magic items or special abilities to boost her skills. That was because Aura had her levels divided between ranger and beast tamer, and it was also because Ainz was just too high-leveled so his base stats were high. Ainz felt regret at not being able to personally experience what Aura talked about.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Leaving that matter aside, Ainz was not good enough at stealth to infiltrate the Royal Capital without using magic. So, he cast [Perfect Unknowable] and on top of that, turned into an elf with illusion magic.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Though it would be difficult to break through his [Perfect Unknowable] considering the strength of an average person in this world, he still had to be careful just like when he was flying in the sky. That was why he went as far as creating an illusion as well.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He never thought for a moment that he knew everything there was to know about this world’s special abilities and techniques. After all, Ainz’s knowledge came from his time in Yggdrasil and even that was not perfect.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He should assume that the other side is using an ability all the time to see through invisibility, just like Ainz did.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz also wore a magic item called the Ghillie-Ghillie Mantle as a part of his stealth setup. Despite covering himself in layers of stealth, he also prepared measures to fool the enemy in case he was discovered. One could never be too careful.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Let’s start then.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">After he reached the boundary between the forest and the grassland—there was no cover to be found further in—Ainz observed the capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">He could see Elves making rounds on the bridges connecting the outer circle of trees that made up the Royal Capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">They were probably equivalent to a city’s walls, the bridges being the allures on said walls.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He didn’t know if they lacked the skills to see through his [Perfect</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">Unknowable] or if they were just not paying attention, but the soldiers didn’t act like they had noticed him. Well, he was going through all this trouble to stay hidden, it would have been embarrassing if they managed to find him so quickly. After he made sure that he wouldn’t be in the line of sight of those soldiers,</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz took out a scroll.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Then he activated the scr—he hesitated. He started again—and hesitated.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had resolved to use it before coming here, but even so, he couldn’t help but feel that it was such a waste. He turned reluctant to activate the scroll every time a thought flashed by that there should be a better way.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wouldn’t have hesitated if he was in a battle with his life on the line—but the fact that he wasn’t in such a desperate situation was the root cause of his hesitation.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After a while, Ainz succeeded in clearing his head and finally activated the scroll. He would have hesitated again if he thought about anything at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The activated spell was [God’s Eye].</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">A ninth-tier spell that created an intangible and invisible eye. This was probably the first time he used this since that time with the lizardmen.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Its range was far greater than [Remote Viewing] and it could also pass through obstacles like walls.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">While this spell was excellent for spying, you couldn’t say that it was the absolute best there was. Though it was invisible, it could easily be detected by second-tier detection spells. Plus, even though it was intangible, if it was destroyed in an attack, the caster would receive damage as feedback. Since this was also considered divination, the opponent could find his location through anti-divination measures or an attack could come flying over if it triggered any automated defenses. The fact that this eye itself didn’t have any HP and it wouldn’t use Ainz’s level or defenses was the main issue.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Even so, as it was far better than going over there and directly observing, it was valuable at times.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It flew at a constant speed—but so slow that Ainz felt a bit impatient—and finally reached the city walls.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Three Elf guards equipped with bows were patrolling as a team, but no one noticed the approaching [God’s Eye].</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Seems like there’s no one with anti-invisibility skills here but… I can’t be sure that there’s no one among the Elves who have classes with such abilities.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">There was no reason for them to overlook the eye if they noticed it, so he should be correct. However, he shouldn’t be careless because it was their first intel-gathering mission in a previously unknown place.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz’s [God’s Eye] passed under the walkways and entered the capital. He immediately brought the eye back after it just entered the city, and then moved it in front of the three guards from before. It appeared that they were talking about something, but they still hadn’t noticed the eye.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Fuuu. it’s all good…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Just like Nazarick, guild bases had traps that activated the moment they were invaded, weakening or nullifying certain types of magic. They could break [Invisibility], reduce the strength of the holy element, et cetera. Ainz checked whether the Elven city had any such traps in place.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">(T/N: Raw had “guild home” in katakana, will assume that’s a mistake until proven otherwise)</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He would have to check again at the important-looking locations within the city, but it seemed like the ordinary parts of it weren’t problematic.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He didn’t want to spend too much time maintaining [Perfect Unknowable]. Considering the amount of mana he would be left with after this, he really didn’t have much leeway.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz gradually made the eye move into the deeper parts of the city. He wanted to find the Elves that resided in trees that corresponded to shops.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">If he thought of it as a usual town, the shops should be clustered together in a convenient place to reach. Considering that they also had to keep inventory on hand, it wouldn’t be strange if they were located in the larger trees.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">After a while, Ainz groaned silently. “—I can’t find them!”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This city, made out of thousands of trees, was nothing but a forest to the human eye. He couldn’t find anything like a signboard because it was night and there were no nameplates on the trees either. It was just rows and rows of trees without any individual characteristics that he could see. He couldn’t be sure that the tree he was looking at wasn’t the same tree he saw just before.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If this was a human city, there would be a thoroughfare with shops arrayed on both sides. They could also be clustered around the main square.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t find any such places here at a glance. With his experience till now becoming useless, he had no choice but to search by intuition.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">This was a city that was not at all welcoming to a traveler. It was hard—no, it was impossible to find his target amidst this.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">That said, it was not like he needed to complete everything today. They shouldn’t be hasty, but instead, take it slow and safe.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Even so, Ainz continued his search for a while after that. He had already activated [God’s Eye] so he might as well use it until it ran out of duration.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">But Ainz could only sigh after his long search.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">—It’s no use doing the same thing again when the residents are sleeping</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He shouldn’t do things without a plan. Even though it would be riskier, he should return to search in the morning. He would probably get a clue by observing the way people moved around. Ainz wasn’t sure how long it would take to accomplish his goal if he didn’t do that.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz selected a random place and sent [God’s Eye] in. Elves use the walkways between the trees to move around the entrances of their homes which would correspond to the first or second floor of a human house. So he decided to infiltrate from the first floor. It was the same principle as a thief looking through drawers. Starting from the second floor would make for terrible pathing.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">After [God’s Eye] passed through the wall, it flew up until it found elves sleeping on the third floor.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He found a father, mother, and two boys sleeping there. It seemed like this house belonged to a family.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">I already heard about this but…how primitive…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The four of them were sleeping soundly on a large amount of leaves collected in what was supposedly a bedroom. Human villages also used dried grass in place of a mattress so maybe this was similar to that.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">According to the elves in Nazarick, this was what a normal Elven bedroom looked like. Although it took a lot of work to collect a large amount of leaves, they could be used for a long time without any issues. When he asked them about being bitten by insects, they replied that a spell was cast on the leaves to prevent that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The children—the two boys were pleasantly sleeping with slow, calm breaths. “Sleep, huh…how did it use to feel like?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">A long time had passed since he gained this body. This body’s lack of the three basic needs and its insensitivity to pain was probably the reason he managed to not collapse till now, but he still felt some regret about it. When he sees such pleasant sleeping faces, he feels nostalgic and a bit envious. Even more so when</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">he sees tasty food.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Good grief…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz shrugged and activated [Greater Teleportation], arriving in front of a large curtain made of vines.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was not weird to see such veils made of vines in the forest, but if one looked at this curtain closely, they would find that it was skillfully hiding a small cottage behind it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This had been their party’s temporary base for these past few days, a Green Secret House created by a magic item.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Fenrir, who was sitting beside the Green Secret House, slowly stood up to sniff its surroundings, letting out a growl while looking—no, glaring in Ainz’s direction.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">But, his line of sight was a bit off.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Just like Aura back then, even Fenrir couldn’t completely sense someone being hidden by [Perfect Unknowable]. Rather, it should be praised for the fact that it even managed to sense Ainz while he maintained [Perfect Unknowable].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz canceled the spell.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Now that it could see Ainz, Fenrir bowed its head with a look of remorse on its face.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Although it couldn’t talk, Fenrir was rather intelligent. Its act of bowing its head was not the instinctual act of a beast but clearly conveyed its apology to Ainz. But Ainz didn’t think that Fenrir was at fault here.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">From its point of view, he had been just some unknown intruder that suddenly appeared here. This was the natural reaction for a guard protecting its master; it would have been more problematic if it hadn’t responded like that.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had only brought this Fenrir with them instead of the usual Hanzos this time. Although Ainz said that he would take a lot of high-level underlings with him, he did not stay true to his words due to certain reasons. In the present situation, where he couldn’t predict how his plan to obtain friends for the twins would work out, he didn’t want to expose information to others if possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">And the other reason.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He stopped allowing the Guardians to head out alone after Shalltear’s brainwashing incident.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">But what was the result? Even though Nazarick started being more active since then, the enemy didn’t appear again. The only one who fell for the bait was a platinum-armored man named Riku Agnesia when Ainz—who was actually</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Pandora’s Actor—appeared alone. It was like the enemy who brainwashed Shalltear didn’t exist at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">That was why.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Since he managed to fish out Riku when there were no Hanzos around, maybe the enemy had a way to detect the presence of the Hanzos.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps it’s some ability of a World Class Item. Or perhaps with some kind of talent.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Therefore, he was performing a dangerous experiment by not bringing the Hanzos along.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He informed Albedo of this reason, but even Ainz could see that there were a lot of faults in his reasoning. She was persuaded by his spiel, smiling all the while, which made him doubt if she was really persuaded. Maybe he would get a talking to after he returns.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“—good work”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz left Fenrir with a curt greeting, feeling a little somber. He then put his hand on the Green Secret House’s door—so camouflaged that one couldn’t find it without knowing that it was there beforehand—and pushed a little.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The door didn’t move.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Unfortunately, as this magic item did not have a keyhole (though it could be forcibly opened by something like Epignoi), one had to request someone inside to open it once it was locked.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz used the door knocker. One could look out from the Green Secret House by making the door translucent from the inside. After a few moments, he heard the door being unlocked.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">And then it opened. “Welcome home!”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“We-wel-come-come…home…”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The one who replied energetically was Aura. Mare slowly followed with his welcome, his eyes completely drowsy.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">Both of them have changed into pajamas, Mare going as far as wearing a nightcap. Of course, this was the correct appearance given the time.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Sorry for making you both wait so late into the night” Ainz said as he entered.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The space inside was filled with a warm light and was far larger than one would expect from its outer appearance.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">You would directly enter the living room from the door and you could see the</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">kitchen and other rooms from there. There were also 4 doors that were connected to the individual rooms.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“No, no, we expected it to take more time when we were informed that you could be late”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I thought so as well, but…let’s not talk while standing here. Let’s sit over there”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He wanted to tell Aura that it was fine to go to sleep. But he should still share the gathered intel with them, even though it’s just a meager amount. Ainz didn’t put much trust in his ability to remember so it’s better to do it as soon as possible.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">While feeling a bit guilty about making them go along with his selfish reasons, he invited them into the living room to talk about what he saw.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Sitting on the chairs there, he found Aura looking attentive in contrast to Mare, who already dropped his head onto the backrest with his eyes half closed. He looked like he would go to sleep any time now. Ainz felt even more guilty when he compared them to the sleeping children from before.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Am I not being considerate about those who need sleep because I don’t need any? This is bad…</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Why don’t we let Mare go to bed? I won’t mind if you informed him about our talk in the morning”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Good grief…” Aura slapped Mare’s head. “Wake up. You are being rude to Ainz-sama, you know?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Fuaah, oh, W-welcome back”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Mare gave a small bow. Ainz couldn’t mock that they already went through that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“This child, really” Aura was getting angry at Mare’s attitude</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“It’s not good to force someone to stay awake. It can affect tomorrow’s opera—”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz shut his mouth suddenly, remembering himself from his YGGDRASIL days.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Of course, he believed that it didn’t affect his office work, but was that really the case? Also, it was different when you did it to entertain yourself versus when you were made to do so for others’ convenience.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz—Suzuki Satoru used to complain when he had to stay late because of his boss.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">First of all, he shouldn’t be comparing children to adults, but it could also be</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">considered wrong to compare a child with the astounding physical ability of a level 100 NPC to an ordinary adult like Suzuki Satoru.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The two of them stared at Mare, whose eyes—half-closed from drowsiness— looked like he was glaring at them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Mare’s head suddenly slid, causing him to panic with his eyes wide open. He then returned his head to its previous position.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He was nearly at his limit.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“—Well then. Let’s do it like this. Mare can go to sleep to not affect tomorrow’s work. His wits will become dull if you forcefully keep him awake and that’s not a good thing. Can you inform him in the morning about what we will talk about here like asked before?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">She should have immediately agreed to Ainz’s orders. Instead, she made a complicated expression, probably thinking that Mare’s behavior was too slovenly for a Guardian. However, it was just for a moment. She deeply bowed, as if she just persuaded herself in her mind.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“…Understood. I will immediately take Mare back to his room. …Can you stand?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Uh, uhhh?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He can’t even give a legible response to Aura, so standing is out of the question. “—Hmmm. Let me carry him”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Aura looked like she wanted to say something, but Ainz ignored her, stood up, and lifted Mare in his arms.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Perhaps because Mare had changed into pajamas and was only minimally equipped, he found Mare to be quite light. No, normal children probably only weighed about this much.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It would have been harder if he was fully equipped, though it’s not like I couldn’t carry him even then… That thing is really heavy…perhaps the heaviest of all of the Guardians’ equipment</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">(T/N: Probably talking about Mare’s staff)</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Since both of his hands—he could have carried him with one hand if he wanted to—were occupied, he let Aura go before him to open the door. He entered Mare’s room and let him down slowly onto the bed.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He had already closed his eyes and was taking slow calm breaths. He probably started sleeping while he was in Ainz’s arms.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz silently exited the room, taking care not to make any sounds. Aura followed him even more silently, as expected of a Ranger.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Both of them returned to the living room and took their seats again.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Immediately, Aura bowed her head and started speaking, “please forgive us for taking a rest while Ainz-sama is working so hard. I apologize on Mare’s behalf. You’d be right to be angry and feel uneasy about his work ethic as a Guardian, but let me assure you that we would usually equip items to remove our need for sleep if we have work to do at night and you wouldn’t see such a slovenly appearance from us. If you were to ask us why we didn’t do so today it’s because our strength in battles would be reduced a bit as equipping the item meant leaving out our battle-focused equipment. So we decided not to equip the item as we will be standing on guard to protect Ainz-sama…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Aura quickly explained. He could feel her anxiety peeking through her uncharacteristic way of talking.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“No, no, you don’t have to worry so much. We are here on vacation after all. There’s nothing wrong with sleeping early. More importantly, what about you, Aura? Don’t you feel sleepy?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">“Ah, no, I would never show you such an unbecoming appearance like that—” “—too stiff, too stiff. I am not feeling angry at all. Rather, I feel happy that I got to see a different side of Mare, you know? You people always end up being too formal in front of me. I now feel extremely curious about how others behave</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">normally. —Like say, how about Cocytus?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“…there’s not much difference from the normal Cocytus” Aura returned to her normal expression.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I see. In that case, should I secretly have a look using [Perfect Unknowable] while he is alone?”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz subtly smiled—although his face didn’t show it, his voice probably relayed his feelings—and Aura too joined in with a smile akin to that of a pranking kid.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Well then, are you sure you don’t want to sleep?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“I am usually awake around this time so I don’t really feel that sleepy”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">According to her, it was common for her to stay awake late into the night to play with those of her monsters that were nocturnal. This “playing” seemed to be important for beast tamers as the monsters would build up stress and wouldn’t operate at full potential if they skipped it. That said, it was not like she was reducing the amount of time she spent sleeping. She just slept late into the day following the night she stayed awake. So, it was something similar to a night shift.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">By the way, if any of the twins had to head outside of Nazarick, they would</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">equip the aforementioned item to skip sleep and stay alert.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">hnn—What should I do about this? It’s natural that the persons in charge would be working hard but shouldn’t the races that need sleep be better off sleeping? Especially children who need a good rest for their growth. Maybe I should discuss it with Albedo…that aside!</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">After he took a breath, Ainz talked about the Theocracy’s camp he saw in The Great Sea of Trees, though he did not manage to figure out their troop strength or how far away they were from reaching the Elven capital. It was just enough to know their armies were still advancing. Coming to blows with the Theocracy is not a part of Ainz’s present mission.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Then, he started explaining the more important matter of his exploration of the Elves’ Royal Capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He talked about everything that happened without hiding anything. There was no use in hiding such matters. He just had to be honest when something was impossible. Also, Aura was different from <i>those </i>two. Maybe she would take his words as they were and give him better ideas about how to proceed.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Is that so…” Aura, who heard his explanation, nodded slightly. “In that case, we should observe them during the day just as Ainz-sama says”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Aah. I am planning to do so but what are you two going to do during that time?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“About that… it’s better If I…don’t infiltrate, right?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“You are right. I think there’s a very low chance of you getting discovered but we still don’t have enough information to be sure. It’s better not to leak who we really are in the present situation”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“In that case, I will talk with Mare tomorrow about his task. But, I am planning on cooperating with Ainz-sama. How about I investigate the surroundings of that city to find any tracks left by the Elves?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz nodded in agreement.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If goods were being transported to the Royal Capital, they should leave some kind of trail behind, however faint. The more used trails are no different from roads.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If they managed to find them, they could also expect to find places frequented by the Elves like the Elven settlements at the other end of the road.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">All of this rested on the assumption that the Elves didn’t use something like [Forestwalker], but Aura’s idea was very good. There wasn’t a single reason for Ainz to object to it.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“It’s a splendid idea. To search all the areas around…would probably not even take a day for you. Work with Mare to search for any trails left behind by them. I’ll be relying on you”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Okay! Understood!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“In that case, I will once again conduct some intelligence gathering during noon tomorrow—actually it’s today, considering the time”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Then I will conduct the search at night because I feel like it’s easier to get noticed in the day”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Umu, I will leave it to you. Well then, let us go to bed as well…Good night, Aura”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“Okay. Good night, Ainz-sama” Ainz stood up along with Aura.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He went separate ways from Aura to the room designated to him, entered it, and laid on the bed. But Ainz didn’t need to sleep because he is an undead. He ended up taking out a book from the item box.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was one of the books on management he had been reading a lot, titled “To become a good leader.” To be frank, he didn’t feel like reading these books was helping him, but it was probably better than not reading them at all.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Ainz started turning over the pages.</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-left: 204pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">♦ ♦ ♦</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p style="padding-top: 9pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz was in a daze for a while. He wasted two precious scrolls on infiltration on the first night and the noon of the second day. Only on the noon of the third day did Ainz finally manage to find important intel. That being said, the only things he found were the trees with shops, but this did let him get a sense for the capital’s layout.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was just a small step for others but a giant leap for Ainz. He was so happy that his emotional suppression was triggered. Therefore, he resolved not to waste this chance. Ainz made sure to remember the route to the shop.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He retreated at that point. There was certainly still some active duration left for the spell. Although he felt extremely curious, wanting to send the [God’s Eye] over to the awfully wide and large tree that was the royal castle and take a peek, he managed to control himself.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">In human civilizations, kings were not always the strongest beings around.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was probably for two reasons. One was that it would be hard for humans to prosper if they followed the strongest instead of the ones who could make better decisions. It was the survival method of a species that was nothing but prey for the other races, who were weaker than the others but also more populous. The other reason was that they occupied comparatively safer areas. That was what was special about the Kingdom, the Empire, and the Holy Kingdom.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">However, for the races who lived in a land that required clashing blades with other races, it was natural to have the strongest of them be the king.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The Elf king was then probably a strong person. In that case, they should not invite meaningless danger after going through all this trouble to be careful.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He had collected various pieces of information on this world until now, but he had yet to meet a strong being that could match him and wasn’t a monster. Maybe if he hadn’t met that mysterious warrior called Riku, he would have been careless and would have looked down on the Elf king. Instead, meeting Riku made him more cautious than ever before.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He dispersed the eye and cast [Greater Teleportation].</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz returned to their base and exchanged the intel he found with the two (Mare with his eyes completely open this time), who had just returned earlier.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He was informed that although they had wasted the second day before realizing the Elves were using the trees to travel, they finally found success in finding multiple trails. It might take different amounts of time to investigate them depending on the distance to the nearest settlement on those roads.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz expressed his unease about being seen by the Elves using those roads if they decided to investigate them.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">In response, Aura said that they would travel along the road on the ground with Fenrir. She confidently proclaimed that as long as they were inside the forest, they would not get discovered. She was so sure of her opinion that it made Ainz think his worries were unfounded. Even so, Ainz did not give his go-ahead for the moment. Instead, he requested them to wait for a while longer. He would likely be getting his hands on some good intel today.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">And so, on the night of the third day.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz approached the Elven royal capital again using [Perfect Unknowable]. Naturally, he infiltrated from a different spot, one he hadn’t visited before. He couldn’t guarantee that he didn’t leave any marks behind on his previous incursions that some excellent ranger among the Elves managed to notice.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He always moved using [Fly] so as to not leave any marks behind, but that was</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">just from Ainz’s point of view who was a layman when it came to stealth and search. He was not confident enough to proclaim that he didn’t break any branches or make the leaves bend in strange directions on his way here.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Honestly, I sometimes wonder why I am being so careful… but it would be bothersome if the nearby Elven villages started thinking that some mysterious entity was prowling around. It would be especially troublesome if they were to be captured by Theocracy and then leak that information to them</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was highly unlikely that this “mysterious entity” would be traced back to the Sorcerer Kingdom, but letting the Theocracy know that there was a third faction nearby would be bad. He was afraid of how the Theocracy would react to that intel. Their unanticipated reaction could throw his plans into disarray.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">…It wouldn’t be a bad idea to pause this now and have a discussion with Albedo and Demiurge, but if I were to do that, my plans for Aura and Mare to make friends would be disturbed.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, the only option left to Ainz was to be as careful as possible.</p><p style="padding-top: 3pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz took out a scroll and quickly activated it. He didn’t hesitate because he was sure there would be concrete results to show for it this time.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Good!” Ainz whispered after infiltrating the target’s Elf Tree with [God’s Eye].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">His target was sleeping, buried in a mountain of leaves. It was a male elf.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Elves were fundamentally a slender race, shorter by about 10 to 20 percent when compared to humans. In addition to that, they barely had any body hair and didn’t grow beards. As they also looked like young adults for a long period of their life, it was extremely hard to estimate their age from their external appearance alone. Most of them look far younger than their real age.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Therefore Ainz was not certain that this elf held the information that he wanted, but there was a reason Ainz chose him as his target despite that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">It was because there the elf lives here alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Abducting an entire family would cause trouble later, but it was easy if it was just a single person.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">He also had another reason, but that can only be confirmed later.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">As he already memorized the route, Ainz directly teleported over with [Greater Teleportation].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">The elf didn’t wake up at Ainz’s intrusion. Rather, it was a given that he wouldn’t even be able to sense Ainz unless he was a high-level ranger.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">Ainz then cast the fourth-tier spell [Charm Species] on him.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The spell triggered without fail thanks to him being asleep and the large gap between their levels.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Wake up,” Ainz spoke to him.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">His [Perfect Unknowable] was dispelled the moment he cast a spell with the intent to harm (or to be more precise in gaming terms, if his magic triggers some resistance). He continued to wake him while shaking his shoulders gently with his hands, being careful not to cause him pain.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“…nnah?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The elf mumbled like an idiot but it couldn’t be helped as he was just woken up now.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Don’t resist, ok?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz ended with that and activated [Greater Teleportation] while he held the elf’s hand.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This spell allowed one to teleport with other people, but they had to be in agreement and not resist the teleportation. It worked here because the “charmed” status was considered as agreement. The “dominated” status should also work in the same way, but he didn’t use this harder-to-resist and higher-tier option because he was on guard against certain things.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">This kidnapping was perfect in execution. You could even call him a first-class criminal.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Good. Just like I planned!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Of course he would be happy because his plan was going so smoothly. While he had a wide smile on his bony face—</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“—Wah! W-what the hell? What is this?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Upon seeing the sudden change in his surroundings and feeling the ground underneath him, the elf jerked up and turned completely awake. He didn’t look like he was still thinking that this was a dream. Or maybe the Elves didn’t have the concept of a dream world in the first place.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Don’t make such a loud voice” “E-even if you told me not to…”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“I used teleportation magic. Calm down. There’s no one here who would harm you”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">“T-teleportation magic?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">The elf continued to panic silently. The only reason he stopped was because the charm magic was still in effect.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">“Well, we are here”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz opened the half-opened door completely and led the elf into the Green Secret House.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Aura and Mare should be observing them from the gaps of their rooms’ slightly opened doors.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He also thought about letting the captive see them, who were Dark Elves, in hopes that it would make him speak more freely. But considering the troubles that this might end up causing in the future, he decided not to.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Although the Dark Elves weren’t considered enemies by the three captured elves, the situation could be different now. Maybe Dark Elves were now considered enemies in the Royal Capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Of course, it wouldn’t be a problem if Ainz said “they are not enemies” to him. “What is this place…Don’t tell me this is the World of the Divine Tree…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz didn’t know a thing about this World of the Divine Tree, but he could guess that it was probably something from their myths and legends. Or, perhaps—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Is it related to some player from YGGDRASIL? There’s a need to investigate, but…I don’t want to spend too much time here. I will do it sometime later.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz made him sit on a sofa in the living room and took a memo pad out. It contained a list of bullet points with the questions he needed to ask. He couldn’t waste any time. If something failed in the process, he would have to kill the guy. Although it was extremely unlikely, someone suddenly disappearing from the Royal Capital could still cause problems in the future.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Tell this friend of yours about various things you know, in as few words as possible,” Ainz continued without waiting for his reply, “is there a possibility that you will die if someone used magic or other means to get information from you?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Huh? No way there’s going to be anything like that on me right?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">The guy looked like he had no idea what Ainz was talking about, but there was a possibility that the elf just didn’t know even if there was such a trap.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">If I remember correctly, it took three questions before it was activated that time…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz took such scenarios into account while he prepared the questions in the memo, so he just needed to go through the list from top to bottom.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Do you know any Dark Elf village’s location?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“…I don’t know the exact place, but I do know their general location in the great forest”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It sounded like it was further south from the Royal Capital. He went into more detail, saying that it was in a place called The Three Trees, where the trees were</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">huge. But, Ainz couldn’t make any sense of it as he didn’t know the layout of this area.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">He would have to rely on Aura, who was listening in. “Continuing to the next question..”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">When he was making this memo, the twins were surprised that he didn’t include this question. Now that he thought about it, it did look important so he moved on to the third question.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“—Tell me what you know about the Theocracy”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“The Theocracy…haa, that horrid country of humans! Those shitheads are attacking us for no reason at all! A country without honor, that attacked us while we were unaware, a bunch of wretches who kidnapped hundreds of Elves,” so started the guy’s denunciation of the Theocracy, which continued on with vigor until Ainz stopped him in a fluster.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">But it did seem like the guy, who was only a commoner, didn’t know how far the Theocracy had advanced. He wasn’t even sure if the Elves were winning or losing. However, seeing the patrols moving in a tense mood compared to before, the common opinion among the Elves was that the situation was not good.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Three questions were asked, but there was no indication of anything happening to the elf. As he thought, that time was an exception. In that case, he could ask the elf everything he wanted to hear about, but he couldn’t really spend that much time with him.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“How are the relations between the Elves and the Dark Elves? They aren’t bad right?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Not really…I think?” Before Ainz could ask him the reason for the slight pause, the elf started speaking again, “I don’t dislike them and I don’t think those around me have any bad feelings about the dark elves either. For us, they are like some kind of distant relatives. But, this is only about how we feel and we don’t know how the other side thinks about us, you know? We rarely meet them so I don’t have a clue about what their feelings are.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Do you know anything about the Sorcerer Kingdom?” “What’s that?”</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Instant reply. Well, he expected this so he wasn’t surprised. Anyway, he determined that nothing in the information acquired just now constituted a hindrance for the plan to make friends for the twins.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“That’s all I wanted to ask. —I am grateful” “It’s all good, aren’t we friends?”</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz unintentionally smiled mirthlessly at the guy’s reply. He was planning on making friends for others, but when the same word was pointed at him, it rang hollow. For Ainz, only his guildmates could ever be called his friends.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“That’s it then.”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Mare popped his head out of the door behind the elf when Ainz sent him a signal. Ainz continued to talk with the guy to divert his attention, “I also wanted to know more about things like Elven culture, but I can’t spend too much time on—”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">He saw the elf’s eyes become drowsy and then he fell sideways onto the sofa.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf was taking slow, calm breaths that were a mark of deep sleep. This sudden turn of events was caused by Mare’s [Sandman’s Sand].</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz made Aura, who was following Mare, confirm that the elf was asleep. “…Aura. Do you think we can reach the Dark Elves’ village using what this guy</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: left;">said?”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">“I feel like I can, probably. But I might need to conduct a detailed recon when we are near it to find the exact location”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: left;">That was good enough for him. Ainz cast [Control Amnesia] on the elf. This was the main reason why he kidnapped—selected—an elf living alone.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Since it was hard to estimate an elf’s age, he couldn’t be sure that he would get an adult with all of the knowledge he required even if he kidnapped a mature- looking elf. There was a chance the elf would end up being a very young person who never stepped outside of the Royal Capital.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">On the other hand, he could be sure if he kidnapped an elf with children, but then there would be as many untied ends as there were members in that elf’s family to deal with later.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If he killed them all just because it was bothersome, it would mean that an entire family would have disappeared from the capital, without any signs of resistance to boot. That would surely create problems for them. He probably couldn’t make it look like they had escaped away during the night due to debt or something.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">And there was no way his mana could last long enough to cast [Control Amnesia] on a whole family like he was doing now.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Therefore, he selected a male elf who lived alone.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz removed the elf’s memories in a single move. Fine manipulation of memories, making sure that the details stayed consistent, was difficult. However, removing them in batches without caring much for the details was not that hard</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">at all.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Plus, the memories he needed to erase didn’t span across that much time. This was the reason why he tried to take as little time as possible for his questions. If he didn’t need to erase the elf’s memories with [Control Amnesia], Ainz would have spent as much time as possible—maybe even until the charm ended or even longer by recasting [Charm Species]—to question him.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Since he controlled the number of questions and was done with the questioning in a short time, he easily managed to delete the memories up till the moment he went to sleep. No, he even ended up erasing a bit more, to the time just before the elf went to bed.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">This was caused by him wiping a bunch of memories at once, but his MP probably wouldn’t have lasted otherwise. Speaking in hindsight, his remaining MP actually looked like it would have held, but hindsight was hindsight.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">He couldn’t do anything about it now, so even if the elf had some doubts, he just had to hope that the elf would reason it out by himself.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">His MP was low, but because they managed to complete the task without an issue by preparing meticulously, he was left with enough to complete the remaining tasks.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“I’m leaving then. Aura and Mare, can you lend me a hand just like we planned?”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Okay! Leave it to me!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Ah, Y-yes. I will do my best”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Aura and Mare held the elf’s limbs, swinging him while they carried him with Ainz at their lead. Considering their strength, one would have been enough to carry the elf but if he was hit by something and it was considered as damage, he may wake up. Then Ainz would have to cast [Control Amnesia] again and he was not sure that his remaining MP was enough for that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">Of course—</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">—I made a different plan for that scenario so it shouldn’t be a problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz first exited the Green Secret House by himself and activated [Perfect Unknowable]. He opened a [Gate] after that.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Naturally, on the other side of the gate was this elf’s house.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz first entered the gate alone and entered the elf’s bedroom. He immediately started looking around while trying to listen for any sounds.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">…Fuuuuh. It’s safe.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">It seemed like there was no one around to be alarmed by the sudden [Gate].</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">For a moment Ainz continued to listen carefully, observing the situation.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">…Looks like…there’s no problem.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: right;">A ranger on Aura’s level could stay silent without letting Ainz hear anything, but it was not like even someone like Aura was doing it at all times. It would be like some farce out of a dark comedy if a veteran ranger existed who, in this short time, managed to notice something was wrong in this house and laid in wait expecting something to occur again. So, Ainz could only assume that it was safe.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz dispelled [Perfect Unknowable] and stuck his head into the gate to send a signal to the twins. They carried the man, swinging by his limbs, through the gate.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">The three of them executed their plan in silence.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">First, Aura and Mare carefully laid the man on his bed made of leaves. It would be too idiotic if he were to receive damage now and end up waking.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">[Sandman’s Sand] caused a deeper sleep than [Sleep]. One would wake up from just a shake for [Sleep] but wouldn’t open their eyes unless they receive damage if it was [Sandman’s Sand].</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">If they left him like this and if no one discovered him and woke him up by causing damage to him, he would gradually die from emaciation. The uproar that would cause was not something Ainz wanted after going through all this trouble to not create any such disturbances.</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">They started preparing to wake the guy up after letting him down on the bed. Ainz looked around the room, trying to find the object he saw when he entered it.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">It was a weird (at least he didn’t find it ordinary) wooden sculpture with a bulging stomach that looked like the cross between a mole and a frog. They didn’t find any such animals in the few days they had spent in the forest. Maybe it was a mythical beast from Elven mythology and legends. Ainz took that sculpture into his hands.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">As I expected, it’s wood. But…it’s heavier than I expected. Not bad…but if it ends up killing him…well, there’s nothing I can do about that</p><p style="padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">It’s very unlikely that they would suspect Ainz’s involvement even if they started a murder investigation.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Upon seeing Ainz with the sculpture, the twins carried the elf under the shelf where the sculpture was.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">After Ainz gave them a nod, the two went first into the [Gate]. Ainz followed them and stopped just in front of it.</p><p style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;">He then threw the strange sculpture into the air.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 21pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">This was the best he could do to not cause a suspicious death that would trouble him later.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">Ainz immediately entered the [Gate] without waiting for the sculpture to hit and dispelled the [Gate] without a second thought.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: left;">“Good. I will go get the final confirmation. Wait for a bit, both of you.” “Okay! Understood! Only a little more, right? Good luck, Ainz-sama!”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Ah, I-I think it should be f-fine if it’s Ainz-sama but…p-please take care because I t-think that your mana could be low”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Receiving the twins’ encouragement, Ainz recast [Perfect Unknowable] and used [Greater Teleportation] to appear in the elf’s room again.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Shit! That’s painful! Why the hell would it fall on its own?! First of all, why am I sleeping in such a place?! Did I drink…I feel like I didn’t… Shit, that’s painful…”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz looked at the wide-awake elf, who was taking his rage out on the shelf. He smiled at the elf, who was becoming more and more tearful from the pain.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Nicely done! A perfect crime!</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf didn’t look like he was acting and he also didn’t seem to suspect anything. —No, it looked like he did have suspicions about the sculpture falling on him, but he probably didn’t think that some strange person came into his room and threw it on him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“…Wait a minute”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Ainz stopped before he could activate [Greater Teleportation] as he heard the suspicion in the elf’s voice.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Did he notice something? Maybe not pinned on us, but still that there’s an intruder? Was there some kind of monitoring equipment—magic item here because it’s a shop? I didn’t find any though…</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“…Is Tsungoga-sama trying to tell me something?”</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">Tsungoga-sama? I don’t remember any such monsters in YGGDRASIL…</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">“Tsungoga-sama. Tsungoga-sama. Please speak if there’s anything I should know”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf kneeled on the floor, his head to the ground and the sculpture in his hands held high. That was the model pose of devotion a highly religious person would take.</p><p class="s33" style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">…so it’s just the native religion? That aside, why does this guy talk to himself so much? Is he intentionally doing this because he thinks that there’s someone around? Or is he</p><p class="s33" style="padding-top: 2pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">just simply praying to this god called Tsungoga?</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The elf seemed to be a different person from the one they kidnapped and used. Ainz hesitated for a moment about whether or not he should kidnap the elf again and kill him, but he ended up deciding not to. For now, it was more likely that he was just praying, but it was still better to be on guard. Ainz wanted to leave something behind to monitor him if possible, but that would be difficult even for Ainz. There was no convenient spell for that. The most he could do was to use magic to check in at times.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">Ainz clicked his tongue—although he didn’t have one—and returned to Green Secret House using [Greater Teleportation].</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">The twins, who were waiting for him, smiled when Ainz dispelled [Perfect Unknowable] and gave him a thumbs up. Honestly, he was a bit uneasy about the elf’s behavior at the end, but since they couldn’t do anything about it, he chose not to tell the twins in case they turn uneasy.</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">(T/N: Ainz appears to be parodying a stereotypical manager on a business trip for the following section)</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“Okay, everyone. Thank you for your cooperation with everything so far. With that, today’s work is done.” The twins looked puzzled at Ainz’s exaggerated action, but immediately smiled again. “As it is getting late, please turn in early so that you won’t feel exhausted tomorrow.”</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">The twins replied with an energetic “Okay!”.</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">“With that, although the day has already changed, I will now decide the time we should be waking up at. Yes—I don’t mind you waking up whenever you want, but don’t go sleeping until noon now you hear? Right-o. If you wake up by 9 o’clock, I will bring you our breakfast from Nazarick”</p><p style="padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 130%;text-align: justify;">They answered with a loud “Okay!”. While Aura slightly poked Mare with her elbow, it didn’t look like she was bullying him.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;text-align: justify;">“Okay, with that—thanks for the hard work everyone!”</p><p style="padding-top: 4pt;padding-left: 22pt;text-indent: 11pt;line-height: 131%;text-align: justify;">Upon hearing Ainz’s words, the two of them also followed with, “thanks for your hard work!”.</p><p style="padding-left: 33pt;text-indent: 0pt;line-height: 14pt;text-align: justify;">“Well then, that’s all folks!”</p><p style="text-indent: 0pt;text-align: left;"><br/></p><p
